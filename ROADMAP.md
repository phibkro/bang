## North star

bang-lang is a small effect-typed language whose **paradigm and runtime are
values, not language features**. The contribution is a **verified two-hop
architecture**:

```
  source ─►  graded-CBPV semantics  ─Bahr-Hutton calc─►  CalcVM
                                                            │
                                                            └─Benton-Hur LR─►  WasmFX
```

The CalcVM is the **executable specification** (canonical operational meaning).
The WasmFX backend is the **optimized compiler output**, proven to preserve
contextual equivalence. See ADR-0016 for the architecture commitment.

Success = a runnable bang-lang program compiled to WasmFX, with kernel-checked
proofs that observed behavior equals what the reference semantics says.

(`group_recovers` RETIRED — ADR-0032.) | ✅ scoped gate met: `lr_fundamental` reads the real proof, `sorryAx` ONLY from the documented ▷-subsystem; ◊2 (`no_accidental_handling` 0-axiom, STD trusted-three) + ◊3 (CalcVM trusted-three) held; arrow clause = peeling+F-restriction (ADR-0038), closed-value carrier (ADR-0036). `lr_sound_closed` (F-typed) proven; `lr_sound`(arbitrary-C)/`zero_usage` → ◊4.5. `effect_sound` (Q14) → ◊5 |

The cheap typed-CrelK close (Architecture D) was BUILD-PROBED (`typed-crelk-probe@ffac1b0`) and is **NO-GO**: `HasStack` pins the bottom answer but the strip's intermediate `KrelS` hole can't be typed (no `KrelS⇒HasStack` bridge; LR one-way) — D only relocates the leak. Only the heavy index-everything reshape remains (4–7 sessions + frozen break, not worth one edge). **Seam was verified-final FOR THE DYNAMIC KERNEL; ADR-0045 pivots to typed+static dispatch, which DISSOLVES the edge** (build-gated — it was an artifact of dynamic dispatch; see CONTEXT ★ ACTIVE DIRECTION + `paths/archive/PATH-typed-static-pivot.md`).

Pick a **suspend/resume** effect (state/generator) for the tracer, NOT `throws` — `throws` lowers to `resume_throw`, unlanded in Wasmtime (#10248). Same value as `Source.eval`. |
| ◊6 | **Release v0** | Three parallel paths from ◊5 converged into a releasable artifact | Public release tag + paper drafts for the three theorems (`lr_fundamental`, `compile_forward_sim`, `group_recovers`/its resolution) |

## Product spine — pulled forward (PRD §7)

`docs/PRD.md` settles that bang-lang is the **language** (not the methodology) and that lang-bang
grows its **own surface** (convergence decision B). That makes the surface the product *spine*, not a
◊5 deferral. So a **thin surface tracer bullet** runs as an **early parallel track** alongside the
verification spine:

```
verification spine:   ◊2 ✓ ──► ◊3 CalcVM ──► ◊4 LR ──► ◊5 compiler ──► ◊6
                                  (backbone — proof rides the reference)
product spine (NEW):  [tracer bullet ✓] ─► thin surface ✓ ─► multi-paradigm MVP (v1) ✓
                       minimal parser → graded-CBPV Comp → Source.eval → a VALUE
                       ✓✓ v1 MVP SPINE COMPLETE (rungs 0–4, 2026-06-23): State · STM ·
                          reactive · user-types on one verified kernel — see CONTEXT.md
```

The tracer bullet is the first product-spine issue (`paths/archive/PATH-tracer-bullet.md`). It de-risks the
surface→kernel lowering — the biggest product unknown — and makes the language *run* before ◊5. The
full end-to-end (surface → CalcVM → WasmFX → engine) thickens as the verification spine reaches it.

This is the **one sanctioned exception** to "linear segments admit no parallelism" below: the product
spine is a *different layer* (surface) from the verification spine (kernel/compiler), so per rule 2
(cross-layer paths run in parallel freely) it does not tangle the ◊-march.

## The layer × path model

Three layers stack vertically. Each layer has its own **invariant discipline**
and its own **cadence**.

```

│   parser · syntax · IDE · errors                              │

## The vertical principle — correctness above, performance below (ADR-0037)

The vertical stack is not just decomposition; it encodes a **contract**:

```
  ABSTRACT layer (above a seam)  ─ fights for CORRECTNESS  (strong invariants, provability)
        │  seam = the contract (observable behaviour = the layer-above's semantics)
  IMPL layer (below a seam)      ─ fights for PERFORMANCE  (rewrite freely, BOUND by the seam)
```

Each **seam IS that contract** — the typed-AST seam, the WasmFX-module + handler-protocol seam. The
preserving theorem at each (`type_safety`, `lr_fundamental`, `compile_forward_sim`) is what **forbids
the implementation from assuming an invariant the layer above does not actually prove** — the
miscompilation guardrail.

**Corollary — constraints are generative:** every invariant *proven* in the layer above is one the
layer below gets to *assume* instead of *check*, so the deleted dynamic check **is** the performance.
Correctness and performance are **one ledger viewed from two sides** (instanced: QTT grade-0 → no code;
effect rows → no dynamic dispatch; linearity → no GC; shared-nothing → no Iris + no locking). Invariant
#7 ("performance second-class") is this principle's near-term face: we don't chase speed directly — we
**earn** it by proving invariants upstream. Full treatment + the shared-nothing concurrency instance:
ADR-0037.

## Parallelism rules

1. **One path per layer at a time.** Two paths in the same layer touch the
   same files → they tangle. Sequence them, or split one off.
2. **Cross-layer paths run in parallel freely** — that's what seams are for.
   The typed contract at each seam is the synchronization point.
3. **No path crosses ◊ without re-aligning.** When a path reaches its target
   checkpoint, `CONTEXT.md` updates and any other paths must re-anchor to
   the new state before continuing.
4. **Linear segments (◊1 → ◊2 → ◊3 → ◊4) admit no parallelism.** The
   architecture changes propagate too widely; forking before ◊5 risks
   reworking the same code in two paths.

## Paths from ◊5 (the first real fork)

```

   │   (effect-specific lowerings, dead-code, zero-grade erasure)
   │
   ├──► PATH-kernel-extensions ─ owner: kernel-engineer + proof-engineer

       (parser, type-checker, CLI, error messages)
```

## What's frozen vs liquid

| | Frozen | Liquid |
|---|---|---|
| **Kernel layer** | rows-as-sets · five primitives · graded-CBPV substrate · calculation-as-method | proof-body internals · helper lemmas |
| **Compiler layer** | two-hop architecture · WasmFX as target · LR as correctness notion | individual machine designs · optimization strategies |
| **Surface layer** | AST seam contract | EVERYTHING ELSE — syntax · glyphs · error formats · CLI shape |

Frozen things change only via K-ADR + downstream re-validation. Liquid things
change without ceremony.

**Amnesiac team model**: a fresh agent reads `CLAUDE.md` → `CONTEXT.md` →
`paths/PATH-<active>.md` and has enough context to continue. `ROADMAP.md` is
slow background. Memory is the index; files are the substance.

## ADR taxonomy

Future ADRs are tagged by layer for cull discipline:
- **K-ADR** (kernel): semantic decisions; near-permanent; deep review
- **C-ADR** (compiler): methodology decisions; stable statements, evolving impl
- **S-ADR** (surface): experimental; expected to churn; cheap to write/delete

S-ADRs may be deleted outright when superseded. K-ADRs are superseded but
preserved. C-ADRs are case-by-case.

## When to update this file

- Reaching a checkpoint (mark ◊ as ✓; advance the "current" cursor)
- Adding a new path or layer
- Changing a checkpoint definition (rare; treat as architecture change)
- A K-ADR lands that affects the architecture diagram

Everything else goes in `CONTEXT.md`.
