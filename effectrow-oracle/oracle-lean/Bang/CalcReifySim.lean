# Toward the reification bisimulation: the pure core

ADR-0015's open theorem is `exec ∘ compile ≡ run` for `CalcReify`, a
machine/interpreter **bisimulation** relating the flat machine's defunctionalized
`Kont` to the reference's real `Comp` continuations (`CalcReifyRef`). This file
starts that proof from the bottom: the **pure core** — the cases of the induction
that involve no effect (`val`/`add`/`var`/`let`). These are the base every
effect case rests on, and they already exercise the genuinely-new bits of *this*
machine vs the prior ones: a flat `Code` stream with the handler stack `K` carried
as a passenger, return-through-`K` on empty code, and `BIND`/`UNBIND` for `let`.

The statement is the continuation-passing simulation of Bahr–Hutton (cf.
`CalcCBN.sim`): if the continuation `c` succeeds with the value pushed, then
`compile e c` succeeds with the same result — with the handler stack `K` and the
rest of the data stack `s` universally quantified and threaded unchanged. We pin
the pure denotation with a structural evaluator `pden` (no fuel: pure terms are
strongly normalising); `eval_pure`/`pure_correct_ref` below prove `pden` is
exactly the `ret`-fragment of the real reference `CalcReifyRef.eval`, so the pure
core is a genuine machine-vs-reference agreement, not a parallel definition.

**Scope / honesty:** the inductive `pure_sim`/`eval_pure` cover the pure fragment
(now incl. `handle` over a pure body — an unfired handler is transparent). Beyond
that, `fire_agree` proves the **first ∀-quantified *firing* result**: for any pure
payload `e` and pure non-resuming `clause`, machine and reference agree on `handle
clause (perform e)` — the clause genuinely runs with the captured continuation.
The key was the *environment-independent* structural fuel bound `fuelOf`, which
breaks the circularity the reference's fuel-capturing resumption closure would
otherwise create; the partial `RelEnv.consK` constructor relates an opaque machine
`vcont` slot to a reference `ek` slot (sound here because the clause never reads
it). The remaining residual is a **resuming** clause — the full step-indexed
`vcont ↔ ek` relation, where the two resumptions must agree *when invoked*. This
file is `sorry`-free: it asserts only what it proves.

not merely "no `perform` syntactically". A `handle clause body` with a pure body
is itself pure: the body never performs, so the handler never fires and the clause
(whatever it is) is dead — an *unfired handler is transparent*. This is the natural
stepping stone into the effect cases: it exercises the machine's `INSTALL`
instruction and the return-through-a-handler-frame path, without yet needing the
`vcont ↔ ek` relation (the handler is installed but its clause is never run). -/

*nothing* about how the two resumptions behave when invoked (that is the open
step-indexed residual), only that the slot may be ignored. It is sound for the
present results precisely because the clauses we prove about are **non-resuming**
(`IsPure`): they never read the slot as an integer, so its contents are irrelevant.
`relEnv_lookup` still holds because it only ever resolves `ev` entries — an `ek`
slot can never match `some (ev n)`. -/

/-! ## A first **firing** handler, proven generally (the `vcont ↔ ek` frontier)

The pure cases never trigger a clause. Here is the first *firing* result that is
**universally quantified over programs**, not just `rfl` on specific ones: a
`handle clause (perform e)` where `e` and `clause` are pure (the clause may read
the **payload**, but does not itself resume). The body performs once; the clause
runs with the payload; the (captured) resumption is discarded or used opaquely.

This is exactly where the `vcont ↔ ek` wall stands, and the proof shows *why* the
structural `fuelOf` was the key. The reference builds a resumption closure `res`
that **captures the ambient fuel**; naively, the fuel needed to evaluate the clause
*under* `res` could depend on `res`, a circularity. But `eval_pure`'s bound is
`fuelOf clause` — computed from the term alone, independent of the environment — so
`res` is irrelevant to how much fuel the clause needs. The clause's denotation is
likewise independent of the resumption slot (`pden` never reads inside an `ek`),
which we record by quantifying the clause hypothesis over **all** `g`. -/

/-! ## A `handle`-over-pure-body demonstrator

`handle 999 (let x = 5 in x + 3)`: the body performs nothing, so the (zero-shot)
clause `999` is dead and an *unfired handler is transparent*. Both the machine and
the reference yield `8`. This is the `IsPure.handle` case end-to-end — the
`INSTALL` instruction and the return-through-a-handler-frame path, exercised and
proven against the real reference, with no `vcont ↔ ek` relation needed. -/
example :
    let prog : Src := .handle (.val 999) (.letE (.val 5) (.add (.var 0) (.val 3)))
    (∃ F, run F prog = some (.vint 8)) ∧ (∃ G, CalcReifyRef.run G prog = some 8) :=
  pure_correct_ref (.handle (.letE .val (.add .var .val))) (by rfl)

/-! ## A **firing** demonstrator via `fire_agree`

`handle (payload + 1) (perform 41)`: the body performs with payload `41`; the
clause reads the payload at index 0 and adds 1 → `42`, *discarding* the captured
resumption (zero-shot). `fire_agree` proves the machine and the reference both
yield `42` — for this instance, but through the universally-quantified firing
theorem, not a bare `rfl`. -/
example :
    let prog : Src := .handle (.add (.var 0) (.val 1)) (.perform (.val 41))
    (∃ F, run F prog = some (.vint 42)) ∧ (∃ G, CalcReifyRef.run G prog = some 42) :=
  fire_agree (e := .val 41) (clause := .add (.var 0) (.val 1))
    .val (.add .var .val) (by rfl) (fun _ => by rfl)

/-! ## In-Lean machine-vs-reference agreement on **firing** handlers

The inductive `pure_sim`/`eval_pure` above cannot yet reach a *firing* handler (a
`perform` that actually triggers its clause, possibly resuming): that needs the
`vcont ↔ ek` step-indexed logical relation, the open residual. But agreement on
any *specific* closed firing program is provable **right now**, because both
`CalcReify.run` (the flat machine) and `CalcReifyRef.run` (the free-monad
reference) reduce by computation: each side is a closed `rfl`. So `⟨rfl, rfl⟩`
proves the two *independent* implementations land on the same integer.

This is strictly stronger than the harness fuzz (`reify-cps.ts`): there the
cross-check is empirical and the reference is in TypeScript; here it is a
*machine-checked Lean proof* that the calculated machine and the in-Lean
denotational reference agree — on the genuinely-hard cases (non-tail, multi-shot,
re-handling) the general theorem still owes. It is program-specific, not the
universally-quantified bisimulation; but it is real, proven, and covers exactly
the firing behaviours `pure_sim` cannot. -/

/-! ## The step-indexed `vcont ↔ ek` relation (the resuming-clause frontier)

The residual ADR-0015 names: a *resuming* clause proved ∀-generally. The partial
`RelEnv.consK` above relates a `vcont` slot to an `ek` slot while asserting nothing
about *invoking* them — sound only because every clause proven so far is `IsPure`
(non-resuming). Here we build the real relation: a machine `vcont` relates to a
reference `ek g` exactly when invoking the one (a `RESUME` splice) agrees with
invoking the other (`g w`). Because `g w = handleC fuel (k w) clause cEnv` re-runs
the captured continuation — which may perform/resume again — the agreement is
inherently **step-indexed** (Hillerström–Lindley–Atkey).

Design (from the design panel + its adversarial critiques):
* **`def`, not `inductive`.** `RelV : Nat → Value → Entry → Prop` is *structurally*
  recursive on the index: the `vcont ↔ ek` clause at `i+1` refers to `RelV` only at
  the predecessor `i`. The resumption `g : Int → Comp` occurs only *applied*
  (`g w`) — a positive use in a function body — so there is no strict-positivity
  obligation (an `inductive` here is rejected). The `∀ j ≤ i` flavour the deep
  cases need is recovered from the `i`-indexed fact via downward closure.
* **`observe` is a pure head-match, no fuel.** The reference's `eval`/`handleC`/
  `bind` are eager and return a fully-formed `Comp`, so `g w` is already a value;
  observing its head is exact, matching `CalcReifyRef.run`.
* **Conditional forward simulation** (machine halts with `r` ⇒ reference agrees),
  the same shape as `pure_sim`/`fire_agree`, so divergence maps to `none` on both
  sides rather than a false termination claim.
* **The `RESUME` splice config is copied *literally* from `CalcReify.lean`** (both
  spliced frames carry `retEnv := <resume-site env>`), so the relation's antecedent
  matches the state the machine actually steps to.

/-- Observe a fully-evaluated reference computation. The reference is eager, so a

/-- **The step-indexed value relation.** Structural recursion on the index: the
`vcont ↔ ek` clause at `i+1` mentions `RelV` only at `i`. Structural mismatches stay
`False` at *every* index (so `relEnv_lookup` holds); only the `vcont ↔ ek` slot is
vacuously related at budget `0`. The inlined first hypothesis is the continuation
correspondence `RelK i` (the ADR's `CodeKont = compile <$> SrcKont`, observationally
relaxed): feeding a related value through the clause's own machine continuation
agrees with the reference context. -/

no need to re-prove the structural induction. -/
