# 0043 — ◊4.5b: scoped-seam for nested-wrapping-handler resumption (the `lr_sound` moat scope)

<!-- adr-frontmatter -->

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Summary**: ◊4.5b's resume-through-a-wrap edge is excluded by a scoped seam (the `NoWrapMiss` primitive is landed); the cheap typed-`CrelK` close (Architecture D) was build-probed NO-GO (no `KrelS⇒HasStack` bridge — the LR is one-way), so the ADR-0026 tested-descent seam is the verified-final answer for this edge.
- **Depends-on**: 0041, 0039, 0026, 0025, 0023

- **Status:** Accepted — and the seam is now the **verified-FINAL** answer for this edge: the cheap typed-`CrelK` close (Architecture D) was build-probed and is **NO-GO** (2026-06-24; see "Probe result" below). The only remaining close is the heavy index-everything reshape (rabbit-hole, 4–7 sessions + a frozen-statement break), not worth one tested-descent edge.
- **Layer:** C+ (LR metatheory / proof architecture)
- **Depends on / amends:** [0041](0041-cap45-recursive-fragment-needs-later-modality.md) (the `▷` subsystem ◊4.5b lives in), [0039](0039-cap4-non-triangleright-split.md) (the ◊4/◊4.5 split), [0026] (the verified-core / tested-superset descent), [0025] (deep resumptive handlers), [0023] (handler dispatch)

## Context

◊4.5b's resumptive logical relation is one obligation from a fully axiom-clean `lr_sound`:
`krelS_splitAt_decomp`'s **handleF-MISS** case — a handler dispatch whose captured continuation,
up to the catching handler, contains a **non-catching handler** (the "nested-wrapping" / "wrap-MISS"
edge). Everything else is closed: throws/state/txn equivalence at the catching frame, and resumption
through a captured continuation (`krelS_append`, the Biernacki §5.4 Lemma-2 config-append, build-proven).

Two fully-general closes were build-confirmed DEAD before this decision:
- **Pinned-index reshape** (re-index `KrelS` by a determined answer type): `KrelS`-answer-determinism
  is **FALSE** — the `letF` clause existentially quantifies the continuation type `B`, so two
  derivations over the same stacks pick different answers. Recorded as a rabbit-hole in task #10.
- **No-strip / circular**: building the goal `KrelS` at `Dᵢ` directly needs the reinstalled handler's
  own resume conjunct — exactly what is being proven; `krelS_splitAt_decomp` lacks that interface.

## Decision

**The nested-wrapping-handler-resumption edge is excluded by a SCOPED SEAM, not closed.** The
relation-level primitive `NoWrapMiss` is landed; the sorryAx-zero close (which requires a TYPED
`CrelK`) is build-pinned and deferred to a dedicated kernel session.

### What landed (relation level — `2b4479b`, whole-tree green)

`Bang/Operational.lean` gains a standalone predicate:

```
NoWrapMiss : EvalCtx → Label → OpId → Prop
| [],                _, _  => True
| (handleF h :: K),  ℓ, op => handlesOp h ℓ op = true ∨ splitAt K ℓ op = none
| (_ :: K),          ℓ, op => NoWrapMiss K ℓ op
```

`NoWrapMiss K ℓ op` says the dispatch of `(ℓ, op)` reaches its catcher **without passing through a
non-catching handler** (the captured continuation up to the catcher is handler-free). `¬ NoWrapMiss`
is *exactly* the splitAt-wrap-MISS edge. The kernel, `KrelS`, and the whole relation stay **pristine
at `e755afa`** — `NoWrapMiss` touches nothing else.

### Covered / excluded

- **COVERED** (sound + proven): all observation contexts including **legitimate handler stacking** —
  every dispatched op caught by its **nearest** enclosing handler (single-level handling; state-over-
  throws and any focus-installed handler nesting where each op hits its nearest handler; resumption
  through a handler-free captured continuation, via `krelS_append`).
- **EXCLUDED** (the narrow seam): resumption where the captured continuation **up to the catching
  handler contains a non-catching handler** — i.e. a dispatched op is caught by a handler that is
  **not** its nearest enclosing one (it "passes through" a shallower non-catching handler). This is
  the single `krelS_splitAt_decomp` MISS sorry (`Bang/Compat.lean`), the ADR-0026 tested-descent
  boundary: the catching-frame equivalence is fully verified; the pass-through edge is the documented
  descent.

### Why sorryAx-zero needs a TYPED `CrelK` (the deferred close)

To make the MISS obligation vacuous, the biorthogonal closure `CrelK` must range only over stacks
that handle the focus's ops at the nearest handler. **Every simple stack-scope predicate on the
runtime stack `K₁` walls** (build-and-reasoning-confirmed, this session), at one root cause: the
fundamental theorem's handle-arm pushes the focus's **own** handler (`handle h M` runs `M` over
`handleF h :: K₁`), which violates any runtime-stack scope:

- row-indexed `NoWrapMissRow K ε`: walls at `crelK_ret`'s `letF` (row `e → φ` change; no `φ ≤ e`
  without typing);
- row-agnostic "∀ ops `NoWrapMiss`": walls at `crelK_ret`'s `handleF` (passing `handleF h` on a `ret`
  exposes `h`'s masked ops);
- fully-`HandlerFree K₁`: walls at the handle-arm (`HandlerFree K₁ ⊬ HandlerFree (handleF h :: K₁)`).

Distinguishing the focus's **legitimately-pushed** handler from a **context wrap** requires the focus
structure — a `CrelK` re-indexed by typing (`HasCTy`/`HasStack`), threaded through the whole mutual
block and every frozen `Crel` consumer. That is the **pinned-index-reshape order of magnitude** and is
deferred together with it as the **"nested-wrap resumption" kernel project** (see `paths/archive/PATH-cap45-finish.md`).

## Rejected alternatives

- **Pinned-index `KrelS` reshape** — DEAD (answer-determinism FALSE; build-confirmed).
- **`HandlerFree`-restriction ON THE `KrelS` handleF clause** (forbid a handler's tail from holding a
  handler) — OVER-FORBIDS: it bans legitimate handler stacking (state-over-throws is valid + tested;
  the reinstall lemmas build `handleF h :: K` with `K` a handler stack), so it breaks `krelS_refl`.
  The wrap-MISS edge is **narrower** than "no nesting," so it cannot live as a `KrelS` restriction.
- **Scope `lr_sound`'s `ctxApprox` alone** — INSUFFICIENT: the sorry is upstream in `crelK_fund`
  (`= lr_fundamental`), which proves `CrelK` for ALL stacks; its handler/`up` arms carry the obligation
  regardless of how `lr_sound` later instantiates it.
- **Bare `sorry`** — rejected: the seam is STRUCTURAL (`NoWrapMiss` + the documented descent), so the
  limitation is explicit, not papered.

## Consequences

- The kernel and `KrelS` stay pristine (`e755afa`); `NoWrapMiss` is the durable relation-level artifact.
- `lr_sound`/`lr_fundamental` retain the single documented `krelS_splitAt_decomp` MISS sorry — the
  honest moat scope, the verified domain being everything except pass-through resumption.
- ~~The path to sorryAx-zero is fully specified~~ → **PROBED, NO-GO** (see below). The seam is final for this edge.

## Probe result (2026-06-24) — Architecture D (cheap typed-`CrelK`) is NO-GO

A 5-agent design panel recommended **Architecture D** (literature-canonical typed `CrelK` that *proves* the
MISS rather than vacating it; scope as a PREMISE not an index, so the frozen statements survive;
~3–4 sessions): use `HasStack`'s answer-index to recover the junction answer type the MISS sorry says
`KrelS` lacks. A bounded GO/NO-GO **build probe** (branch `typed-crelk-probe` @ `ffac1b0`,
`Bang/Compat.lean` ~1466–1597) split the bet and the build cleanly arbitrated it:

- **Answer-projection half WORKS** — `hasStack_append_handleF_split` is PROVEN, `#print axioms` = `[propext]`.
  `HasStack` *does* carry the **bottom** junction answer `Dᵢ` invariantly down the left stack. The panel was right here.
- **Strip half WALLS (the killer)** — `krelS_strip_handleF` carries `sorryAx`. The genuine structural wall is the
  `letF`/`letF` recursion: the strip's IH demands the recursive `KrelS` at a **returner** hole, but `KrelS.letF`
  yields a tail at an **arbitrary existential intermediate** `B` that `HasStack` typing of the LEFT stack does
  **not** pin onto the `KrelS` index — there is **no `KrelS ⇒ HasStack` bridge** (the logical relation is one-way:
  typing ⇒ related, never the reverse), and even if `B` were pinned it need not be a returner.

So `HasStack` fixes the **answer-projection** (bottom) but the strip's recursion needs the **intermediate**
`KrelS` hole typed — which the one-way LR cannot supply. **Architecture D only RELOCATES the leak** (E's panel
finding "`KrelS.letF` existential `B` leaks" is correct *at the build level* and survives full left-stack typing).

**Consequence:** the only path to sorryAx-zero is typing `KrelS`'s **intermediate** holes — i.e. re-indexing the
whole mutual block (Architecture A / heavy-D), which the panel scored as 4–7 sessions **with** a forced
frozen-statement break. Not worth it for a single tested-descent edge. **The ADR-0026 scoped seam is the
verified-final answer.** Durable evidence: `typed-crelk-probe @ ffac1b0` (both lemmas committed, the wall
documented inline at the `sorry`).

## Literature sweep (2026-06-25) — no indexed technique avoids the typed-relation / Iris / semantics-change cost

A 6-angle sweep of the indexed references (`references/papers/`) mined the SOTA + canonical handler-LR
literature for any technique that exposes the intermediate continuation answer type (or dissolves the
wrap-MISS) within our hard constraints — untyped executable oracle (#1), calculated VM (#4), Lean-not-Iris
(#3), frozen statements. **Conclusion: no viable technique was missed; the literature CONFIRMS the seam.**

- **blaze (POPL'26, relational handler-LR SOTA)** — *dissolves*, but its move is a **syntactic side-condition**
  (`neutral(ls,K) ≜ ℒ(K)∩ls=∅`, §4.1.2) that excludes the conflicting-handler prefix — which IS our landed
  `NoWrapMiss`. SOTA corroboration of the discipline, **zero new machinery**. Its model is Iris-built; closing
  the strip wholesale = an Iris port (off-limits). The README's "▷ eliminable via greatest fixpoint" is the
  paper's *speculative future-work* (§7 l.1417–1420), not a delivered Nat-step construction. λ-blaze is
  **untyped** and §4.4 explicitly "cannot state contextual refinement because it depends on types" — so it
  offers nothing to pin our existential intermediate `B`.
- **Biernacki "Handle with Care" (POPL'18) / Benton–Hur / Pitts** — *solves*, and confirms the diagnosis: the
  canonical continuation relation is **hole-type-indexed from the start** (Fig.7, `K⟦τ/ε⟧`, `C⟦τ1/ε1⤳τ2/ε2⟧`),
  so the intermediate type is **never existential**. Our untyped `KrelS` is the deliberate deviation. The fix
  is "do what Biernacki does" = the declined 4–7-session reshape + frozen-statement break, **plus a new
  invariant-#2 tension** (his `EN↪N` partial-map count wants a *multiset*; our rows are *sets*).
- **Lexa / lexical-tunneled dispatch (Ma OOPSLA'24; Zhang POPL'19 tunneling)** — *dissolves* by making the
  MISS **unrepresentable** (lexical op→handler resolution removes the deep search past a non-matching handler),
  the only untyped candidate. But build-check shows the cost is understated: `splitAt`/`dispatch` is threaded
  through the **calculated machine** (`CalcVM.lean`), so it forces re-running the Bahr–Hutton calculation +
  re-verifying the CalcReify bridge **and overturns ADR-0023/0024's dynamic dispatch** (a frozen kernel
  decision → a new ADR, not a patch). Cost ≈ the declined reshape, to delete one tested edge.
- **Affect/Hazel (Iris protocols + Löb)** — *partial*: dissolves by **replacing** the relation with a
  protocol-`Φ` WP (heavier than the reshape) and is **unary**, not contextual-equivalence (binary frontier
  unsolved; its own README routes binary to blaze).
- **AsmFX "Effect Handlers All the Way Down" (annotated simulation)** — *partial*: type-free, but the
  leave-record is a **compiler-derived** location annotation unavailable to the untyped `Source.step` (#1),
  and it's forward-sim for *compiler* correctness, not `lr_sound` contextual equivalence.
- **WasmFX tags / Iris-WasmFX (the "metadata through labeling" question)** — *no-help*: a tag is only a **key**
  into a typed declaration table; the answer type must still be populated by something typed at the `handleF`
  push, which the untyped oracle cannot supply = **Architecture C with one indirection**. Iris-WasmFX is
  likewise one-way (typing⇒op-sem). The only portable idea — its `x∉h1*` name-matching side-condition — again
  just corroborates `NoWrapMiss`.

**Net:** every route to exposing the intermediate answer type is (a) a typed relation index (the declined
reshape, and even the canonical form has an inv-#2 tension), (b) an Iris-native mechanism (off-limits), or
(c) a calculated-semantics change (Lexa, cross-cutting + an ADR reversal). The untyped `KrelS` deviation is
what *buys* invariants #1/#4; this one edge is its exact, principled price. A durable reconfirm, if ever
wanted, is a ≤1-session `stackAnswer : Stack → CTy` probe (predicted NO-GO at `krelS_letF`, the same
answer-determinism-FALSE). Sweep artifact: workflow `wf_6a9f7d3f-ab1`.

## Narrowing probe (2026-06-25) — the edge does NOT shrink by wrap-kind (it is kind-agnostic)

A bounded build-probe tested whether the excluded edge narrows to *resumptive-through-resumptive* by
closing the **throws-wrap** sub-case (a throws-wrap aborts zero-shot, discarding the captured `Kᵢ`, so its
resume conjunct looked trivial). **Verdict: NOT NARROWED** (clean NO, nothing committed, whole-tree build
GREEN 724 jobs, axioms unchanged). The matrix collapses to **wrap-kind only** (the MISS conjunct is the
resume clause for the *wrap* `hh₁` itself; the catcher's kind never appears). Throws *does* discard `Kᵢ`,
but that only **relocates** the obligation: the residual goal needs `KrelS m (F qᵣ Aᵣ) Dᵢ eₛ Ki' K₂ᵢ` while
the only available hypothesis is `KrelS n C Dᵢ e Ki' K₂ᵢ` at the wrap's **opaque hole `C`** — and nothing
forces `C = F qᵣ (opArg ℓ op')`. This is the SAME "`KrelS` does not expose a stack's answer type" wall,
surfacing at the wrap-hole `C` instead of the strip's `Dᵢ`. state/txn-wraps wall *a fortiori* (they also keep
`Kᵢ`). **Ledger:** the MISS sorry is required for EVERY wrap kind (throws included) — the obligation is
recovery of the wrapping handler's hole answer-type, which `KrelS` structurally hides, independent of whether
the wrap discards (throws) or keeps (state/txn) the captured prefix. So the "any pass-through" EXCLUDED
wording above is exact; the edge cannot be tightened without the same typed-relation machinery that is NO-GO.

**Closure status:** the seam is now confirmed from THREE independent angles — the typed-`CrelK` build probe
(can't recover the intermediate), the literature sweep (no indexed technique avoids the typed/Iris/semantics
cost), and the narrowing probe (can't even shrink the edge by wrap-kind). The question is settled.
