# Architecture Decision Records

Each ADR records a decision a future session could otherwise reverse or relitigate: the **rationale**, the **rejected alternatives**, and a **"Revisit if"** clause that distinguishes legitimate reconsideration from drift. Read the relevant ADR before changing anything it covers.

## Layer taxonomy

ADRs are tagged by layer (see `../../ROADMAP.md`):
- **K** — kernel (semantic); near-permanent; deep review required to change
- **C** — compiler / methodology; stable statements, evolving implementations
- **S** — surface (liquid); experimental; cheap to write/delete

> **Recent culls:**
> - **ADR-0003** (own-the-runtime) and **ADR-0004** (calculated-VM-canonical) → deleted, subsumed by **ADR-0016** (two-hop architecture). See 0016 for the current position.
> - **ADRs 0010–0014** (per-machine K3 calculations) → collapsed into **ADR-0017** (K3 retrospective). The five were execution records; the retrospective preserves the load-bearing insights (composition map, methodology, shared-Value equality). The proofs themselves remain in `effectrow-oracle/oracle-lean/Bang/Calc*.lean`.
> - **ADRs 0005 and 0007** → rewritten as kernel-layer semantic principles (glyph specifics moved to the liquid surface layer; filenames refreshed).

| # | layer | decision | status | depends on |
|---|---|----------|--------|------------|
| [0001](0001-effect-rows-as-finset-semilattice.md) | K | Effect rows are idempotent sets (join-semilattice), modeled as `Finset` | Accepted | — |
| [0002](0002-lean-over-fstar-for-the-oracle.md) | C | Verify the reference in Lean 4 + Mathlib, not F\* | Accepted | 0001 |
| [0005](0005-reactivity-as-operator-not-keyword.md) | K | Reactivity is an operator distinction, not a separate kernel form (semantic; surface glyph liquid) | Accepted | — |
| [0006](0006-explicit-tracked-capture.md) | K | Capture is explicit and tracked; no implicit lexical closure | Accepted | 0016 |
| [0007](0007-explicit-force-and-fixed-precedence.md) | K | Force is always explicit; grouping ≠ forcing; precedence is global (semantic; surface glyph liquid) | Accepted | 0005, 0006 |
| [0008](0008-eval-free-monad-handler-fold.md) | K | Definitional `eval` is a fuel-bounded free-monad interpreter; handlers are a deep fold | Accepted | 0016, 0001, 0006, 0007 |
| [0009](0009-calculated-vm-extrinsic-staged.md) | C | Calculated VM is extrinsic and grown one constructor at a time, from an arithmetic kernel | Accepted | 0016, 0008 |
| [0015](0015-continuation-reification-generalised-continuation-machine.md) | C | Continuation reification — flat generalised-continuation machine (`CalcReify`); CalcReifySim bisimulation **paused** per ADR-0016 (LR subsumes the goal) | Accepted | 0017, 0009 |
| [0016](0016-two-hop-architecture-calcvm-and-wasmfx.md) | K+C | Two-hop architecture: graded-CBPV reference, CalcVM as executable spec, WasmFX as verified compiler target (subsumes 0003 + 0004) | Accepted | 0001, 0002, 0015 |
| [0017](0017-k3-calculated-machine-retrospective.md) | C | K3 calculated-machine retrospective — preserves composition-mechanism map and methodology insights; replaces 0010–0014 | Accepted | 0009, 0008 |
| [0018](0018-effect-row-lacks-constraints.md) | K | Effect-row algebra extended with lacks-constrained quantifiers (set discipline); enables `no_accidental_handling` | Accepted | 0001, 0016 |
| [0019](0019-typing-context-split-gradevec-and-types.md) | K | Typing context split into a Finsupp grade-vector + ambient type context (resolves Q3, enables the Q10 resource-enforcing rules) | Accepted (partially superseded by 0020) | 0001, 0016 |
| [0020](0020-de-bruijn-representation.md) | K | De Bruijn indices for the term representation — dissolves 5 named-encoding side-conditions (4 machine-checked falsities); resolves Q11 | Accepted | 0019, Torczon OOPSLA'24 |
| [0021](0021-std-block-typing-corrections.md) | K | Effect/grade typing corrections surfaced by the STD block — lam carries body effect, handle restricted to F-bodies, Mult→CommSemiring, progress at F-type; makes preservation/progress/type_safety provable; advances Q4 | Accepted | 0019, 0020, Torczon OOPSLA'24 |
| [0022](0022-effect-operations-up-rule-and-handler-discharge.md) | K | Effect operations: `up` typing rule + `EffSig` operation signatures + label-discharging `handle` + progress/type_safety at `⊥`; makes effect-soundness non-vacuous. Resolves Q5, completes Q4. Unit 1 landed; Units 2–3 staged. **D3 superseded by 0023** | Proposed | 0018, 0019, 0020, 0021 |
| [0023](0023-ck-machine-deep-handlers.md) | K | CK machine for deep handlers — `Source.step` becomes config-level (`EvalCtx × Comp`); throws discards the captured continuation. Supersedes ADR-0022 D3 (progress-at-`⊥` under the shallow substitution step was machine-checked false); resolves Q6 (throws case). Corrects the `handleThrows` answer-type premise | Accepted | 0020, 0021, 0022, Levy CBPV |
| [0024](0024-abstraction-safety-monomorphic.md) | K | Abstraction-safety: `no_accidental_handling` restated faithfully (the ∀-`h` placeholder was vacuous) + proven — correct-by-construction in the label-indexed machine; `WfInst` concretized to carry the lacks-constraint (`rowinst_requires_disjoint` proven). Closes the ◊2 gate. `effect_sound` deferred (trace-semantics Q14) | Accepted | 0018, 0023 |
| [0025](0025-resumptive-state-handler.md) | K | Resumptive state handler (rung 1 / Q12): `dispatch` keeps the captured continuation Kᵢ + reinstalls a deep `state ℓ s'` frame (one-shot resume). The CK machine's closed focus dissolves the grade tension — no ω-restriction on the state type. `no_accidental_handling` stays 0-axiom; `progress` proven incl. state; 2 `preservation` obligations (resumed-stack typing) tracked | Accepted | 0023, 0020 |
| [0026](0026-correctness-ladder-and-checker-boundary.md) | K+C | Correctness is a dispatched ladder (verified > tested > unsafe); the kernel defines semantics only, checkers are a pluggable layer; user-law discharge defaults to assert + property-test, climbs on demand; the moat is two-level (sound floor + laddered specs); descent is explicit. Resolves the proof-power dial (design-space #2) | Accepted | 0016, 0024 |
| [0027](0027-polymorphism-staged-monomorphic-v1.md) | K+C | Polymorphism is staged: v1 is monomorphic (concrete types; `Stack Int`), then Hindley-Milner (decidable inference), then System F + effect-row variables (cashing the K1 unifier) + grade polymorphism. Resolves Q17 / design-space #1 | Accepted | 0026, 0001 |
| [0028](0028-verified-core-tested-superset-stratification.md) | K+C | Verified core + tested superset, separated by an explicit seam — at three levels: correctness (ADR-0026 ladder), tooling (Lean spine + diff-tested surface; surface stays Lean for now), language (total fragment vs `Div` fuel-bounded superset; resolves the meta-circular/totality wall — `eval` is fuel-total or `Div`-tested, as `Source.eval` already shows). Adopt `plausible` for the tested rung at rung 2 | Accepted | 0026, 0027, 0002 |
| [0029](0029-iso-recursive-adts.md) | K | Iso-recursive ADTs (sum + product + μ with `fold`/`unfold`) for the data layer; inductive (coinductive → Div); μ-recursion-var ≠ polymorphism (monomorphic preserved); equi-recursive rejected (coinductive type equality, zero functional gain); surface hides coercions in constructors/patterns. Resolves Q18 / design-space #4 | Accepted | 0027, 0026, 0028 |
| [0030](0030-stm-as-transactional-handler.md) | K | STM enters v1 as a transactional handler (`state ⊗ exception`, abort discards write-delta keeps allocations) — NO new kernel primitive; `retry ≈ abort`, `orElse` in the minimal core. Privilege (runtime-owned shared heap) is **concurrency-only** and deferred — grounded in Harris PPoPP'05 (journal/validation is *implementation*, not semantics). Rung-3 moat law = all-or-nothing atomicity (opacity's single-threaded degenerate case), `plausible`-tested. Invariant #3 reframed, not dropped | Accepted | 0025, 0023, 0001, 0026, 0016 |
| [0031](0031-calcvm-resumptive-state.md) | K | CalcVM resumptive state: `evalD` threads a label-keyed **store** servicing `get`/`put` **inline** (`raised` reserved for throws — big-step can't resume via a continuation-less Outcome); the machine RESUMES with a non-discarding **`OP`** instr — **shape (A) stays** (the current code `c` IS `Kᵢ`; shape (B)/continuation-reification is multi-shot only, ADR-0015). Bridge = store↔frame correspondence (keyed by label, not an address-heap). State first, transaction (ADR-0030) folds in after; one-shot in-place only. Ports ADR-0025/0030 to the calculated machine | Accepted | 0025, 0030, 0023, 0016 |
| [0032](0032-group-recovers-retired.md) | P | `group_recovers` RETIRED — the `[AddGroup Eff] → seqComp c (recover c) ≈ idComp` rollback law is FALSE as a plain `≈` (refutable: a diverging `c` makes `(c;ret()) ≉ ret()`), vacuous (no `AddGroup` instance for the idempotent join-semilattice `Eff`), and redundant: v1 rollback is a HANDLER mechanism, proven by `all_or_nothing_abort` (ADR-0030/0031), not an effect-algebra inverse. `≈` UNCHANGED (no LR-spine re-derivation). Q8 (H-K Frobenius bridge) unresolved-but-bounded. ◊4 PROOF_ORDER #2 research gate paid off. Supersedes ADR-0018's "group ⇒ rollback" row | Accepted | 0018, 0030, 0031, 0001 |
| [0033](0033-lr-relations-row-indexed.md) | P | The LR relations are indexed by the effect row ε (faithful Biernacki τ/ε): `Crel`/`Krel`/`Srel` gain the `Eff` arg — the 2-arg `Crel` was an under-specified Phase-A stub (the kernel keeps the row independent of `CTy`, and it's load-bearing in `Srel`'s control-stuck clause). `lr_sound`/`lr_fundamental` thread the row (`lr_fundamental` reuses the `e` already bound by its hypothesis). A faithful tightening, not a weakening; surfaced by ◊4 U2 + authorised as `STATEMENT_CHANGE_OK`. Relations are WF defs over a plain lex measure `(n, sizeOf type, role)` — no iris ▷ needed | Accepted | 0021, 0023, 0016 |
| [0034](0034-lr-fundamental-env-closed.md) | P | `lr_fundamental` amended to the env-closed (open-term) form `HasCTy γ Γ c e B → ∀ n δ₁ δ₂, EnvRel n Γ δ₁ δ₂ → Crel n B e (closeC δ₁ c)(closeC δ₂ c)` — the bare `c c` stub was FALSE for open `c` (`ret (vvar 0)` at `Γ=[unit]` needs `Vrel unit (vvar 0)(vvar 0)`) and couldn't be the induction invariant (descends under binders into open sub-terms). The bare `c c` is retained as the named `Γ=[]` corollary `lr_fundamental_closed`, which feeds `krel_refl` → the `lr_sound` capstone. Faithful tightening (Biernacki/Ahmed); surfaced by ◊4 U6 + `STATEMENT_CHANGE_OK`; landed `133a4c1` | Accepted | 0033, 0023, 0016 |
| [0035](0035-lr-for-equivalence-simulation-for-compilation.md) | C | Biorthogonal LR proves ◊4's two-sided contextual-equivalence theorems (`lr_sound`/`lr_fundamental`/`zero_usage_erasable`); AsmFX-style one-directional **annotated simulation** is the method for ◊5's `compile_forward_sim`. Complementary, not substitutes — forward sim never relates two source programs, so it cannot reach `≈`; ⊤⊤-closure is exactly the compositionality the equational theorems need and the compile theorem does not. ◊4 confirmed NOT over-built. AsmFX (Lindley Oct'25) is the method, not the target (Q9: pin the engine, not the paper). | Accepted | 0016, 0033, 0034 |
| [0036](0036-lr-closed-value-carrier.md) | P | LR closed-value carrier (`Val.Closed v := ∀ k, shiftFrom k v = v`) enforced at `Krel`'s return-half + `Srel`'s resume-half quantification, plus an `EnvRel`-filler conjunct — NOT `EnvRel` alone. The ◊4-resume-point's EnvRel-only recipe was incomplete: binder-case plug-values flow from `Krel`'s ∀, and `Vrel` is not closed in general (a `vthunk` of an open comp is `Vrel`-related at `U φ B`). Faithful (CK machine plugs only closed values, ADR-0025/0030). Unblocks `closeC_subst_comm` + all binder cases; landed sorry-free `f6d0ce2`, ◊2/◊3 gates held. | Accepted | 0034, 0033, 0025, 0030, 0016 |
| [0037](0037-abstract-correctness-implementation-performance.md) | C | **Principle:** abstract model fights for correctness; implementation fights for performance *upholding the semantic contract*; constraints prove performance by *removing the runtime obligations* the implementation must uphold (the constraint makes the fast path SOUND — already instanced by QTT grade-0 erasure, effect-row specialisation, the LR/sim split). **Concrete enforcement:** the concurrency runtime is SHARED-NOTHING — actors/cores = separate wasm instances, by-copy messages, manager is message-passing not shared-memory; invariant = no cross-instance shared TVars / no shared global heap in `Wasmfx.run`. Keeps the ADR-0035 forward-sim method valid to multicore (shared-nothing ⟹ no Iris); pre-committed before ◊5 code can violate it. | Accepted | 0016, 0035, 0030, 0026, 0028 |

## Canonical exemplar

**Read `0016-two-hop-architecture-calcvm-and-wasmfx.md` first when writing
a new ADR.** It exhibits the format we want: Context (1-3 paragraphs),
Decision (concrete + actionable), Why this model (numbered list of
reasons), What it commits to (the consequences), Consequences for other
ADRs (subsumptions/deletions), Rejected alternatives (each with "why
not"), Revisit if (the legitimate reconsideration triggers).

Template stub: `adr-template.md` in this directory (or copy 0016 and edit).

## When to write an ADR

- The choice is reversible by a future session — without an ADR, they
  WILL reverse it.
- The "why" is non-obvious from the code alone.
- Rejected alternatives are worth recording (saves re-thinking).
- The decision spans multiple files / subsystems.

Skip ADRs for: bug fixes, refactors that don't change semantics, formatting,
typo fixes. Those go in commit messages.
