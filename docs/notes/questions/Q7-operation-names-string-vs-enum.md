**Question**: `Comp.up` carries an `OpId := String`. Source.step matches
on string literals `"raise"`, `"get"`, `"put"`. String-typed operation
names lose type safety (no exhaustiveness check; typos compile).

**Options**:
1. Keep `OpId = String`. Pragmatic; user-extensible.
2. Symbolic enum: `inductive OpId | raise | get | put | ...`. Type-safe
   but not extensible without modifying the kernel.
3. Per-effect operation namespacing: each `Eff` carries its own operation
   alphabet (similar to algebraic theory presentation).

**Recommended**: (1) for now. Revisit if proofs demand string-free
operations.

**Blocked on**: nothing. Style/ergonomics question.

**Revisit signal**: cannot prove a property because it requires
exhaustive case analysis on operation names.
