## Position

> **★ ACTIVE DIRECTION (2026-06-27) — SOUNDNESS: grade-driven-liveness engine PORTED into the diagonal + the Coh
> layer built; **task #45 RESOLVED** (case/split scrutinee gating) — the LIVE front is now coh_step + the assembly. The COMPILER's next two hops are
> DECIDED.** On `typed-static-r1` (docs/design); proof on `inc5-lr-reindex` @ `957dce7` (PUSHED; `Bang.Model` green
> save the lone `wsCfg_step` sorry; the full assembly is MAPPED, see task #44). **WHERE IT STANDS:** engine (β bridge + POP wall + ⇒FocusResolves + seed)
> ported to all 18 formers, `WScfg` rides the typeless `LWSV/LWSC/LWSK`; typeless restack + MINT freshness; rig
> bounds; the **Coh graded-mirror layer** (ADR-0060 (A+) — cap-bridge untouched, coherence a separate layer); the
> discharge rig + all non-case/split arms. **task #45 RESOLVED (2026-06-27, `c63348b`, gate-verified):** NOT the
> kernel `q≠0` restriction first weighed (that would make a SOUND `q=0` 'inspect-tag-discard-payload' program
> untypeable) — instead the `case`/`split` scrutinee now gates at `b ∧ decide(q≠0)`, the SAME gate every other
> scaled position (ret/app/appF) already uses across all four invariant layers (LWSC/LWSCk/LWSCp/LWSCg); it was the
> lone scaled position that never got it. The discharge `lwscg_to_lwsck` (+ `lwsvg_to_lwsvk` + the false-base pair)
> is WRITTEN + axiom-clean (⊆ {propext,Quot.sound}). **LIVE FRONT — the soundness ENDGAME, fully MAPPED + de-risked (the hard discoveries are done):**
> `lwscg_subst` (graded subst-preservation) CLOSED axiom-clean (`2987bbd`) — but the KEY DISCOVERY is it's OFF the
> critical path. Prototyping the CONSUMER (`reduce_live_preserves_lwsc`/`mint_preserves_lwsc`, gate-verified
> `[propext,Quot.sound]`) showed the assembly's live-β `LWSC` preservation runs through the existence-lift **PIECE 1**
> (`lwsvg_of_typed`/`lwscg_of_typed`, DONE `302ca8b`) + the typeless `lwsc_subst`, dead path via the projection
> `lwscg_to_lwsck` — the graded `lwscg_subst` is called by NO arm. So the feared PIECE 2 (`∀γ'` occurrence-count
> mutual, blocked by QTT non-cancellativity) fully DISSOLVED. **The endgame = the `wsCfg_step` assembly:** a
> ~200-line per-arm build, EVERY arm pinned to a DONE lemma (PIECE 1 + typeless bridges + restack), over
> `WScfg ∧ WellCounted` (extended `957dce7` for MINT id-freshness). TWO sorries remain: **caps-resolve** — the ONE
> real obligation: `∀ p ∈ capsV v, ResolvesLabel K` at the REDUCE `v`, discharged from typing-performability + the
> stack's `LWSK` (NOT off `LWSV`-true — a thunk-buried cap is `LWSV true`-dormant-inhabited, = `wbad`) — and
> **DISPATCH** (#35, deferred). → `type_safety` sorryAx-on-DISPATCH-only. THREE refutation witnesses pin the design
> (`CohSubstRefute` · `LwscgLengthRefute` · `LwscgOfTypedRefute`, kept, axiom-clean). RESUME: build the `wsCfg_step`
> assembly per the **task #44 per-arm map** (mechanical, every mechanism a DONE lemma) → green save the 2 named
> sorries → discharge caps-resolve → done. Handoff: `/tmp/lang-bang-handoff-2026-06-27-wscfg-endgame.md`. METHOD WIN:
> the endgame went from "two hard problems" to "one mechanical build + one located obligation" by prototyping the
> CONSUMER to read the interface off it instead of building the producer blind (memory `orchestrating-hard-formal-proof`). **The
> soundness arc:** inc-4 metatheory → ADR-0055 global-fresh → **ADR-0056** (the diagonal machine-checked FALSE —
> a cap escapes a ⊥-typed program) → **ADR-0057 B-occ** → the `wsCfg_step` POP arm exposed the **deep B-occ lever
> as machine-checked FALSE** (an arrow-guarded cap survives `app`-elimination into a `¬LabelOccurs` answer type;
> `escapeB_app`). A three-way build-checked survey REFUTED every first-order fix (▷-later, reachability, naive
> grade-gate) → **ADR-0060 grade-driven liveness**: a TYPELESS `LWSV/LWSC` invariant gated `b ∧ decide(q≠0)`
> (dropping the type index dodges the dependent-elim wall), committing the grade rig to **NoZeroDivisors +
> ZeroSumFree + Nontrivial** (QTT/ℕ qualify; rings fail). The **engine is build-confirmed axiom-clean** (12 lemmas
> ⊆ {propext,Quot.sound}) for the two HARD arms — the β/REDUCE subst bridge + the POP wall — plus the positive
> direction (⇒FocusResolves + seed). **NOW: porting** the engine into the diagonal module (tasks #41→#42/#43,
> single-writer); after port `wsCfg_step` closes for PUSH+REDUCE+MINT+POP save **DISPATCH** (the resume-continuation
> liveness, tied to #35) → `type_safety` reaches `sorryAx`-on-DISPATCH-only.
> **COMPILER (Lexa comparison + Wasm-3.0): ADR-0058** (the binary-LR Canonical wall is a frozen-signature
> artifact → route 1 deletes it; build-confirmable, task #33→inc-6) **+ ADR-0059** (Wasm 3.0 + grade-directed

## Most recent stable checkpoint

**◊1 — Reconciliation landed (2026-06-20)**

What changed:
- **ADR-0016** committed (`docs/decisions/0016-two-hop-architecture-calcvm-and-wasmfx.md`)
  — establishes the two-hop architecture: graded-CBPV semantics → CalcVM
  (Bahr-Hutton) → WasmFX (Benton-Hur LR).
- **ADRs 0003 (own-the-runtime) and 0004 (calculated-vm-canonical) deleted** —
  subsumed by 0016, not just superseded.
- **ADR-0015** annotated: CalcReifySim bisimulation is **paused**
  (LR subsumes the goal); the machine itself stays.
- **`references/`** scaffolded — 30+ papers organized into topical subdirs,
  `refs.bib` seeded.
- **`ROADMAP.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `paths/`** scaffolded — the orchestrator-
  layer doc system.

## Subsequent landings (housekeeping; not new checkpoints)

### SOTA literature sweep + reconciliation (2026-06-21)

Five-axis web sweep of 2024–2026 literature, integrated. **Four of five axes
confirm our frozen choices; the WasmFX target drifted.** See
`references/README.md` → "Integration findings".
- Library reorganized by pipeline stage (`papers/1-kernel 2-calcvm 3-lr
  4-wasmfx adjacent`); 7 new papers fetched + sorted; `refs.bib` corrected
  (the "calculating-effectively" PDF is Garby-Hutton-Bahr Haskell'24, not the
  ICFP'22 it was labeled).
- SOTA confirmations cited in source: Yoshioka ICFP'24 (join-semilattice =
  exact effect-safety structure) → `EffectRow.lean`/ADR-0001; Zhang-Myers
  POPL'19 tunneling (accidental-handling origin) → `Spec.lean`; McDermott
  FSCD'25 → `Core.lean`.
- **WasmFX drift** recorded as OPEN_QUESTIONS Q9 (◊5 obligation, pin-to-engine).
- Commit `33e5349`.

### subst_value reframed → ◊2 is bigger than it looked (2026-06-21)

Fixing the (vacuous) `subst_value` exposed that the typing rules **carry but
never enforce** grades — `HasCTy` is grade-insensitive. The real graded
`subst_value` is now stated (sorry); proving it (and `zero_usage_erasable`,
`effect_sound`) requires a **resource-enforcing rule upgrade** (Torczon-faithful:
`vvar` grade-one-at-x, `ret`/`app` scale+add). Decision: **Path B** (do the
upgrade, don't weaken the lemma). Recorded as **Q10 (active)**; sequences
**Q3** (context rep → Finsupp grade-vec + type ctx) first.

- **Lean toolchain v4.30.0** (Mathlib matching). Build green: **729/729**.
- **Module split**: Spec.lean → Core / Mult / Syntax / Operational / LR /
  Compile / Spec (PRD). Each module owns its definitions; Spec.lean is the
  frozen theorem-statement manifest.
- **Loogle** added as `lake require` —
  `nix develop --command lake exe loogle "?n + 0 = ?n"` for Mathlib type
  search.
- **`tools/eval.sh`** — submit Lean snippet via stdin (with `import Bang;
  open Bang` prepended), get elaborator output. Programmatic Lean for agents
  without an MCP bridge.
- **`tools/check.sh [FILE]`** — fast per-file error check.
- **`tools/burndown.sh`** — Phase B burndown chart per module.
- **`.editorconfig`** + **`.vscode/`** + **pre-commit hook** + **dev-env
  rationale** (Nix manages elan only — never Lean itself — so Mathlib's
  olean cache stays live).
- **Tactics survey** (`docs/notes/tactics-survey.md`) — `grind`, `iris-lean`,
  custom aesop rule sets recommended for Phase B.

### Codebase merge (2026-06-21)

- `bang-lang-wasmfx/` merged into root Lean project; `effectrow-oracle/`
  flattened to root per standard Lean conventions.
- **Deleted**: TS differential harness, F* alternate, `Bang/EvalJson.lean`,
  `effectrow-oracle/oracle-lean/Main.lean`.
- **ADR-0018** (effect-row lacks-constraints) extracted from wasmfx ADR.

### Phase A part 2 (2026-06-21)

Spec.lean axioms **44 → 36** (8 closed):

| Closed | How |
|---|---|
| `Val.subst` / `Comp.subst` / `Handler.subst` | concrete mutual structural recursion |
| `Ctx.scale`, `Ctx.add` | concrete (List-based; `Mult.*` arithmetic) |
| `isReturn` | concrete pattern-match on `Comp.ret` |
| `HasVTy`, `HasCTy` | mutual inductive Props (4 + 6 typing rules) |
| `Source.step` | substitution-based small-step, sizeOf-terminating |
| `Source.eval` | fuel-iterated step |
| `Disjoint` | `_root_.Disjoint` from Mathlib (post-Q1, Lattice + OrderBot) |

**Q1 resolved (option a)**: Eff algebra switched from `[Semiring Eff]` to
`[Lattice Eff] [OrderBot Eff]`. Concrete instance:
`Bang.EffRow := Finset Label` (in `Bang/EffectRow.lean`). Operator changes:
`0` → `⊥`, `+` → `⊔`, `l * e` → `l ⊔ e` in `no_accidental_handling`.

**Q2 resolved**: `Mult` concretized as `Bang.QTT = {zero, one, omega}` with
`CommSemiring` instance (`Bang/Mult.lean`). All Semiring laws via case
analysis. Spec stays parametric in `[Semiring Mult]`; QTT is the default.

**Operational-side headline theorems** (subst_value, preservation, progress,
type_safety) now have CLEAN axiom sets: only `sorryAx` + the kernel-trusted
three (propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound). Proof bodies are the only
remaining gap → Phase B PROOF_ORDER #4 (STD block).

## Product definition

**`docs/PRD.md`** is now the canonical product doc (2026-06-22 product zoom-out). bang-lang is the
**LANGUAGE** (verified, multi-paradigm, own-surface — convergence decision B); audience = human + agent
developers ("safe to generate into"); moat = proof-by-construction; north-star golden test = a verified
OS (xv6; seL4/CertiKOS lineage). v1 MVP = imperative/State + STM. The **surface is pulled forward** as a
product spine (PRD §7) parallel to the verification spine — see ROADMAP.md "Product spine".

## Active paths

**Product spine (surface — the rungs; PRD §3.1):**
- **rung 0 ✓ DONE** (`paths/archive/PATH-tracer-bullet.md`) — surface → graded-CBPV `Comp` → `Source.eval` → a
  VALUE. The language RUNS (pure + throws). `Bang/Surface.lean`: named AST + name→de-Bruijn lowering +
  fuel-total parser + `#guard`/`rfl` demos.
- **rung 1 ✓ DONE** (`paths/archive/PATH-rung1-state.md`) — first resumptive paradigm: State. `dispatch`
  RESUMES (ADR-0025; the closed CK focus dissolved Q12's grade tension — **no `ω`-restriction on `S`**).
  `preservation`/`type_safety` **AXIOM-CLEAN** (the 2 obligations closed: `dispatch_state_typed` keeps
  `Kᵢ`); `no_accidental_handling` 0-axiom held; State runs **from source text**
  (`state 0 in (let z = put 7 in get) ⟶ 7`).
- **rung 2 ✓ DONE** (`paths/archive/PATH-rung2-stack.md`) — verified `Stack Int` (monomorphic, ADR-0027); the
  **first concrete moat demo**. Iso-recursive ADTs (ADR-0029: sum/product/μ + fold/unfold) landed as the
  kernel data layer (`3738556` K1), metatheory **axiom-clean** (`b4adc42` K2 — preservation/progress for
  case/split/unfold via new canonical-forms inversions), Stack surface + push/pop laws **property-tested
  green via `plausible`** (`6883b61` L — the FIRST ADR-0026 *tested*-rung use; mutation-verified
  non-vacuous). ◊2 gate held on every commit (`no_accidental_handling` 0-axiom). The biggest rung yet
  (a whole ADT layer + metatheory), and it **confirmed the ADR-0029 bet**: iso-recursive made the
  metatheory cheap (syntactic type-matching, no coinduction). Q19 (laws *surface* syntax) stays partial —
  laws stated in Lean for now; the *discharge mechanism* (plausible) is now demonstrated.
- **rung 3 ✓ DONE (kernel + verified law)** (`paths/archive/PATH-rung3-ledger.md`) — verified ledger; **STM as a
  transactional handler** (ADR-0030: `state ⊗ exception`, NO new kernel primitive; privilege =
  concurrency-only, deferred). `Handler.transaction` = rung 1's state handler generalized to a heap;
  rollback is **by construction** (abort = `throws` escaping the frame, dropping the heap with it).
  Commits: `ff13252` K1 (handler + ledger runs) · `df9f9ff`/`1042540` K2 (TVarRef=int + total store fix,
  metatheory closed). **The moat CLIMBS the ladder**: `all_or_nothing_abort` is **PROVEN** (axiom-clean
  `[propext, Quot.sound]`, in `Audit.lean`) — a *verified* law, above rung 2's *tested* one. ◊2 gate held
  every commit. **Follow-ons (not blocking the GOAL, which is met):** `orElse` needs a *recovery handler*
  (the ADR's "costs nothing" was optimistic — `throws` discards, doesn't run an alternative); a
  from-source-text `atomically {…}` surface (parity with rung 1's `state … in`); general-`S` TVars
  (default-witness, ADR-0030 amendment). TVar reps are v1 simplifications (TVarRef=int, S=int, total
  default-initialized store) — see ADR-0030.
- **rung 4 ✓ DONE** (`paths/archive/PATH-rung4-reactive.md`) — reactive cell; the LAST v1 MVP rung. **Reactivity
  is EMERGENT, not a new kernel form** (ADR-0005, now empirically + formally validated): a reactive cell
  is an *unmemoized thunk over a State cell*; each `force` re-samples = pull-based reactivity. **ZERO
  kernel edits** — the rung validates the thesis rather than adding a capability. Liveness law **PROVEN**
  (`Bang.Surface.cell_reflects_latest`, axioms `[propext]`, in `Audit.lean`) — the third ladder-climb.
  Commit `1208b45`. FINDING → ADR-0005: reactivity is **load-bearing on thunk non-memoization** (now an
  asserted invariant). Push-based/glitch-free reactivity = the deferred dial. ◊2 gate held (surface-only).

> **✓✓ v1 MVP PRODUCT SPINE COMPLETE (rungs 0–4, 2026-06-23).** Four paradigms — imperative/State,
> transactional/STM, user-data, reactive — on ONE five-primitive verified kernel. The moat is demonstrated
> at BOTH ADR-0026 ladder rungs: *tested* (rung 2, `plausible`) and *verified* (rung 3 `all_or_nothing_abort`,
> rung 4 `cell_reflects_latest`, proven). The multi-paradigm thesis is shipped. Post-v1: rungs 5–8
> (systems frontier — QTT-surfaced allocator, cooperative scheduler, fs, driver) → rung 9 (xv6, the golden
> test). STM is now **writable from source** (`atomically`/`new`/`read`/`write` parse + run incl.
> abort-rollback, `06e3076`). Rung-3/4 follow-ons: **orElse** (needs *nested-transaction* semantics —
> discard the alternative's writes, Harris OR3; bigger than a "recovery handler") · general-`S` TVars ·
> push-based reactivity.

**Verification spine (kernel/compiler — the ◊ march):**
- **`paths/archive/PATH-graded-cbpv-eval.md`** — **◊2 GATE MET**: STD block + `no_accidental_handling`
  axiom-clean over the CK machine (ADR-0023/0024). Residual: `effect_sound` (Q14), `zero_usage` (→◊4).
- **`paths/archive/PATH-calcvm-port.md`** — **◊3 GATE MET (2026-06-23); path COMPLETE.** Collapsed the K3 Calc*
  matrix into one graded-CBPV calculated machine. D1=A (calculate from denotational
  `evalD`). Landed axiom-clean: pure CBPV spine (`1d15437`) + `evalD ≡ Source.eval` bridge (`a777ffa`) +
  **deep handlers throws-only** (O1 INSTALL `d995cd0`, O2 THROW abort `8780be6`) + **resumptive state —
  handlers RESUME** (ADR-0031, Unit 4, `fd2bc3d`): `evalD` threads a label-keyed `SStore` servicing get/put
  inline; the machine RESUMES via a non-discarding `OP` (shape-A, one-shot, `c` IS Kᵢ); the throws⊗state
  nesting is handled (outer `put` persists past an inner caught throw) + **resumptive transaction — Unit 5,
  `9b2d531`** (ADR-0031 D4 LANDED): `new`/`read`/`write` RESUME over a list-heap, folded in as a **parallel**
  `THeap` store (op-disjoint from state ⇒ correct-by-construction, NOT a unified sum-cell — see ADR-0031 D4).
  Two build-forced shapes: `evalD`'s op-arm is **OP-FIRST** (matches the kernel's `handlesOp` op-gating);
  the net-HStack-effect is a **two-pass composition** `netEffect = updateTxns ∘ updateStates`. Rollback is
  free (inner txn frame pops its heap on a forwarded raise; outer write persists past a caught throw).
  `compile_correct`, `evalD_agrees_source`, `sim`, `run_evalD` all ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}
  over BOTH arms; ◊2 gate still 0-axiom (independently gated on the committed tree) + **ADT eliminators —
  Unit 6, `505cf53`+`498bceb`**: `case`/`split` via runtime `CASE`/`SPLIT` instructions (non-structural
  erasure ⇒ defer to a fuel-bounded re-`compile` in `exec`, the `SUBST`/`APP` shape; resolves the Unit-2
  defer); **`unfold` ERASES onto `RET` — no instruction** (structural, the `force` precedent; an UNFOLD instr
  would be hand-added redundancy). The split is the calculation's OUTPUT, re-derived per invariant #4
  (`498bceb`). PURE reductions, `evalD` mirrors kernel `Source.step` byte-for-byte; axiom-clean, ◊2 held.
  **✓ Unit 7 — K3 COLLAPSE DONE (`87d5aeb`), ◊3 MET:** the K2 matrix (8 Calc* + `Eval`) retired to git history (`87d5aeb`)
  (ADR-0017; `archive/` removed 2026-06-25 — git is the corpus); CalcReify* reification frontier KEPT
  live (ADR-0015); 16-case 5-axis diff-test battery (`Agree M v := exec(compile M)=some[ret v] ∧ Source.eval
  M=done v` — both reps to ONE observable Val ⇒ false agreement unrepresentable; all `rfl`, 0-axiom);
  `just verify` 723 jobs (732→723 = archive took); independently gated on the committed tree.
- **`paths/archive/PATH-lr-foundation.md`** — **◊4 (ACTIVE; STATEMENTS + INFRA landed, proof BODIES remain).** Done:
  U1 helpers (`0f5891d`) · U2 `Vrel/Srel/Krel/Crel` WF defs (`25a2fdd`, THE CRUX, row-indexed ADR-0033) ·
  `group_recovers` RETIRED (`eca7587`, ADR-0032) · U4 `seq_unit` PROVEN + `NotEvaluated` def (`5042754`) ·
  U5 closed adequacy `lr_sound_closed` (`187be29`) · U6 statement+infra (`7928f02`/`b2c3c10`): `lr_fundamental`
  amended to env-closed form (ADR-0034) + `lr_fundamental_closed`/`krel_refl`/`closeC`/`EnvRel` + the
  non-binding compat cores. **THREE ◊4 frozen-statement corrections (ADR-0033/0034 + sig catches) — the LR
  headlines were Phase-A STUBS being finalised through the proofs.** **RESUME (see the PATH's resume-point
  section):** binding-former `closeC` commutation (the crux) → mutual fundamental induction → `compat_handle`
  → **Blocker 2** (the μ/▷ off-by-one at recursive types — route to the LR-relation thread) → `lr_sound`
  capstone + `zero_usage` corollary. `effect_sound` → ◊5.

**Design corpus settled (2026-06-22/23):** **ADR-0026** (correctness = ONE dispatched ladder
verified>tested>unsafe; kernel=semantics, checkers=pluggable; moat = sound floor + laddered specs;
descent explicit) · **ADR-0027** (polymorphism staged: monomorphic v1 → HM → System F) · the
design-space map (`docs/notes/design-space-map.md`) + Q15–Q20.

## Next stable checkpoint we are paving toward

**◊4 — LR foundation.** (◊3 gate met 2026-06-23; see Position block.)

Definition of stable per `ROADMAP.md`: `lr_sound`, `lr_fundamental`,
`zero_usage_erasable` proven; `Audit.lean` reports axioms ⊆ {propext,
Classical.choice, Quot.sound} for these. (`group_recovers` RETIRED — ADR-0032;
it was false-as-stated + vacuous, and v1 rollback is the txn handler. `effect_sound`
→ ◊5.) **Foundation already landed (2026-06-23):** the LR relations are real
WF defs (U1/U2), row-indexed (ADR-0033); only the proof bodies remain. Input:
the now-ported CalcVM (◊3) + the step-indexed LR machinery sketched in
`Bang/LR.lean` + the references (`references/papers/3-lr/`). The `zero_usage_erasable`
and `effect_sound` residuals deferred from ◊2 also live here (LR-flavored).

**◊3 — CalcVM ported — GATE MET (2026-06-23).** K2 Calc* matrix collapsed into one
graded-CBPV calculated machine `Bang/CalcVM.lean` (Bahr–Hutton); `exec ∘ compile ≡ eval`
proven (`compile_correct` + the `evalD ≡ Source.eval` bridge); K2 matrix archived
(ADR-0017); 16-case diff-test battery green; all axiom-clean. See Position block + the
(now-complete) `paths/archive/PATH-calcvm-port.md`.

**◊2 — Kernel frozen v1 — GATE MET.** `Source.eval` concrete over the CK machine
(ADR-0023); row algebra with lacks-constraints (`WfInst`, ADR-0024 D3);
`no_accidental_handling` proven 0-axiom (ADR-0024 D2). The whole STD block
(`subst_value`/`preservation`/`progress`/`type_safety`) is axiom-clean over the
machine, true for effectful programs. NON-gate residual: `effect_sound` (trace
semantics, Q14), `zero_usage_erasable` (→◊4). NOTE the grade-vec carrier is
positional `List Mult` (ADR-0020), NOT the Finsupp of ADR-0019.

## Outstanding for full ◊2 closure

```
DONE — Path B rule upgrade (Q10/Q3, ADR-0019):
[x] Q3: context representation → Finsupp GradeVec + ambient TyCtx (ADR-0019)
[x] CTy.arr carries argument multiplicity (`arr q A B`)
[x] Re-shape HasVTy/HasCTy to thread + ENFORCE grades (Torczon-faithful)
    landed in Syntax.lean (defs) + Spec.lean + Compat.lean (statements); build green

DONE — de Bruijn rewrite (ADR-0020, `411ed08`) + first STD theorem:
[x] Core/Operational/Syntax/Spec rewritten to de Bruijn; 5 side-conditions GONE
[x] subst_value PROVEN (`d72199e`) — axiom-clean, zero sorry; List carrier held
    (length_eq lemma; no Fin n fallback). Machinery in Bang/Metatheory.lean.

DONE — STD block (ADR-0021, `Bang/Metatheory.lean` §E):
[x] preservation — step-inversion lemmas + subst_value; the β cases needed the
    ADR-0021 lam-body-effect + CommSemiring fixes to make `e' ≤ e` hold
[x] progress — generalized terminal motive (ret ∨ lam ∨ steps), specialized to F
[x] type_safety — fuel induction over progress(F) + preservation
    ALL axiom-clean {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; progress: {propext, Quot.sound}

ACTIVE — the harder block (RESUME HERE). Dependency map (2026-06-22 analysis):
unlike the STD block, NONE of these is a clean isolated proof — each is gated on a
deferred design fork, and the `up` rule CASCADES BACK into the just-proven STD block.

[ ] **Q5 — the `up` typing rule** is the foundation: without it NO effectful program
    type-checks, so effect_sound / no_accidental_handling are VACUOUS (no `up` can
    appear in a well-typed body). Needs: opArgTy/opResTy signature mechanism + a
    Label→Eff embedding (`ℓ ∈ φ` works abstractly as `labelEff ℓ ≤ φ`). ⚠ CASCADE:
    adding `up` makes `handle h (up …)` typeable, so preservation's handle head-redex
    cases (throws/state/get/put) — currently VACUOUS because `up` is untypable — must
    be RE-PROVEN, and that forces Q4 (label-removing handle) + Q6 (handler op
    semantics). So Q5 is the head of a coupled arc, not a standalone add.
[ ] no_accidental_handling — needs RowAll/WfInst/HandlesIntended concretized
    NON-vacuously (HandlesIntended must be an operational/trace property, not
    "= Disjoint"); depends on Q5 (operations exist) + Q6 (handler reduction).
    rowinst_requires_disjoint is near-definitional once WfInst carries the constraint.
[ ] effect_sound — Trace=List Label + traceWithin (needs Label→Eff) + Q4 + Q5.
[ ] zero_usage_erasable — LR-flavored: "0-graded ⇒ not forced" is provable in
    substitution semantics only via 0-SCALED-position reasoning, which Torczon proves
    SEMANTICALLY (resource/semtyping.v). Likely belongs to ◊4 (LR), not ◊2.

**ADR-0022** (up rule + EffSig + label-discharging handle) — Units 1+2 landed; **D3
superseded by ADR-0023** (the CK machine). **ADR-0023 (CK machine) — LANDED, axiom-clean**:
[x] **Unit 1 (ADR-0022)**: `EffSig` typeclass in Core.lean. (opArg/opRes now `Option`, ADR-0023 D6.)
[x] **Unit 2 (ADR-0022)**: `up` rule + label-discharging `handleThrows`. preservation axiom-clean.
[x] **CK machine (ADR-0023)**: `Source.step : Config → Option Config` (deep handlers, throws
    discards the captured continuation); op-partial `EffSig` + `labelEff_sep` (D6, closes the Q13
    op-granularity facet the shallow step couldn't); handleThrows answer-type correction.
    preservation/progress/type_safety re-proven axiom-clean OVER THE MACHINE, true for effectful
    programs. Was forced by a machine-checked falsity in ADR-0022 D3 (shallow-step progress).
[ ] **Unit 3**: no_accidental_handling + effect_sound — now NON-vacuous (operations + deep
    handlers real). The ◊2 headline. Needs RowAll/WfInst/HandlesIntended + Trace concretized.
Defer zero_usage_erasable to ◊4 (LR-flavored; Torczon proves it via semtyping.v).
```

## Pending meta-work (not on the critical path)

- **Pass-A paper fetching**: Pass-A complete; Pass-B can be fetched on demand
  (gap list in `references/README.md`).
- **CLAUDE.md playhead table** — still references deleted ADRs 0010-0014 in
  the right column; should cite ADR-0017 (retrospective). Low priority;
  content remains historically accurate.
- **`codebase-maintenance` skill — pending homelab rebuild** (2026-06-22): the
  general skill is committed to homelab source (`c6746bc`, nix-managed) but NOT
  yet materialized — the operator must run `just rebuild` in homelab. AFTER that:
  remove lang-bang's temporary local copy
  `.claude/skills/codebase-maintenance/{SKILL,BOOTSTRAP,REFERENCE}.md` (keep its
  `instances/` derivation) to avoid two copies of the skill. Until rebuild, the
  lang-bang local copy is what makes the skill available here.
- **`tools/check.sh` follow-up**: the grep false-green is fixed (`d72199e`), but the
  robust fix is to key off `lake env lean`'s exit code, not grep (drift-proof).

## Subagents available

Project-local subagent definitions in `.claude/agents/`:

- **`kernel-engineer`** — graded-CBPV semantics, effect-row algebra,
  `no_accidental_handling`.
- **`proof-engineer`** — Lean proofs, axiom hygiene, LR machinery.

Three more roles (`compiler-engineer`, `surface-engineer`, `librarian`)
designed but not written — activate when their layer becomes active
(◊4+, ◊5+, on-demand).

## Quick orient for fresh sessions

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` — the primary orientation (invariants, glossary, playhead).
2. Read this file (`CONTEXT.md`) — current position.
3. Read `ROADMAP.md` — the map.
4. Read `docs/decisions/0016-two-hop-architecture-calcvm-and-wasmfx.md` —
   the architecture in force.
5. For proof work: read `docs/notes/spec-proof-discipline.md` (PROOF_ORDER
   + invariants).
6. For deferred design decisions: `docs/notes/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.
7. For dev tooling: `docs/notes/dev-env.md`.
8. For Lean tactics: `docs/notes/tactics-survey.md`.
9. Read the active `paths/PATH-*.md` if a path is in flight.
10. Verify locally:
    ```
    nix develop          # dev shell with lean/elan
    just verify          # selfcheck + lake build + tools/audit.sh
    bash tools/burndown.sh   # Phase B burndown chart
    ```

## Update discipline

This file is rewritten when:
- A checkpoint is reached → bump position; archive blocker list
- A new path begins → add to "Active paths"; create `paths/PATH-<slug>.md`
- A path completes → remove from "Active paths"; the seam test is the
  durable record
- Major outstanding work appears or resolves → update blocker list
- A session ends with meaningful state shift → bring the doc current

Do NOT rewrite for: routine commits, in-path progress, casual notes. Those
belong in the active path's `PATH-*.md`.

**On position SHAs.** An `@ <sha>` in the Position block marks a STABLE
conceptual waypoint — the commit where a milestone settled — NOT a live HEAD
pointer. Mid-port, HEAD legitimately runs a few commits ahead of the recorded
SHA; that is normal in-path progress, not drift. The SHA is updated when a new
checkpoint settles (the bullets above), not on every commit.
