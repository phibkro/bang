# PATH — ◊4.5b finish: the append crux + the (g) re-point

**Status:** THROWS CLOSED end-to-end in the new arch (cap45-modality @ 3eca3ce, build GREEN,
axiom set clean: no_accidental 0-axiom, compile_correct trusted-three). The whole ◊4.5b moat is
reduced to ONE research crux + the (g) mechanical migration. Two INDEPENDENT remaining pieces.

## What is DONE (committed 86a906f → 3eca3ce, all green + axiom-gated)

- **`h₁=h₂` handleF clause** (`LR.lean` KrelS) — equal handlers ⇒ `splitAt` fires identically.
- **RESUME CONJUNCT** in KrelS's handleF clause — op-arg-keyed (`opArg h.label op`) under a
  `handlesOp h h.label op` guard, so suppliers pin the resume value's type from the handler
  interface. (The producer lacks `HasStack`; the conjunct CARRIES the typed resume.)
- **`krelS_splitAt_decomp`** (Compat) — extracts same-handler split + related outer tails +
  the resume conjunct at the catching frame.
- **`Handler.label`, `handlesOp_label`, `splitAt_some_handlesOp`** (helpers).
- **THROWS supplies SORRY-FREE**: `compatK_handleThrows` + `krelS_refl` handleF arm (via `crelK_ret`).
- **Producer `up` THROWS sub-case CLOSED** in `crelK_fund` (decompose → []-prefix dispatch agrees
  for throws → `coApproxC_le_anti_step` + extracted `hres`; type alignment from `hArg`+`handlesOp_label`).
- mono/eff lemmas thread the conjunct; WF intact.

## REMAINING PIECE 1 — the `krelS_append` crux (RESEARCH or SEAM; operator decision)

The ONE research question, in 6 new-arch spots that are all THE SAME: `compatK_handleState`,
`compatK_handleTransaction`, `krelS_refl` state/txn arms, `crelK_fund` producer state/txn arms.
- **The crux:** state/txn dispatch KEEPS `Kᵢ` and reinstalls the handler:
  `dispatchOn op v (Kᵢ, state ℓ s, Kₒ) = (Kᵢ ++ handleF (state ℓ s')::Kₒ, ret r)`. The `[]`-prefix
  resume conjunct must bridge to the producer's `Kᵢ`-prefix via **`krelS_append`** (compose the
  kept `Kᵢ` + reinstalled handler + `Kₒ`), AND the **▷-metering** must compose so the 1 dispatch
  step stays payable (likely the resume conjunct at `m<n` per `coApproxC_le_anti_step`, LR:140).
- **Throws needs NONE of this** (`Kᵢ` discarded regardless of length) — hence throws closed cleanly.
- **SEAM fallback (ADR-0026):** if the metering walls after a real attempt, the state/txn-resume
  producer is the tested-superset descent (throws-handlers verified, state/txn-resume diff-tested).

## REMAINING PIECE 2 — sub-block (g), the re-point (MECHANICAL, ~147 old-arch lemmas)

`lr_fundamental` is still wired to the OLD `crel_fund` (over `Crel`/`Krel`/`Srel`); `lr_sound`
(Spec:174) is still `sorry`. (g) wires the headline theorems onto the new arch:
- Redefine frozen `Crel := CrelK`, `Vrel := VrelK`, `EnvRel := EnvRelK` (body swap, **signature
  byte-identical** — the frozen statements don't change).
- Delete old `Krel`/`Srel` + their lemma blocks + old `vrel_fund`/`crel_fund`/`krel_refl`
  (~147 lemmas reference the old bodies; ~218 mentions in Compat). This is the bulk.
- Rewire `lr_fundamental := crelK_fund`; prove `lr_sound` via `lr_sound_closed ∘ krelS_refl`.
- **This is careful REFACTORING, not research.** Best done in a FRESH context (Context-Rot risk on
  a 147-lemma body-swap in a long session). Build-gate incrementally; the gate cannot pass
  mid-migration (the additive-then-migrate sequencing note in PATH-cap45-rebuild applies).

When (g) lands AND the append crux resolves (research or seam): `lr_sound`/`lr_fundamental` →
trusted-three = the full contextual-equivalence moat.

## (g) STATUS — LANDED (cap45-finish: `fc4a168` LR, `08f5442` Compat, `07aee4a` Spec)

The body-swap is DONE and build-green. Old flat `Vrel`/`Crel`/`Krel`/`Srel` + `crel_fund`/`vrel_fund`/
`krel_refl` + old compat cores DELETED (grep gate clean). Frozen `Vrel`/`Crel`/`EnvRel` re-pointed to the
answer-typed `VrelK`/`CrelK`/`EnvRelK` via `abbrev` (signature byte-identical). `lr_fundamental :=
crelK_fund` — axioms `[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, `sorryAx` traces SOLELY to the
append crux. `no_accidental_handling` 0-axiom + `compile_correct`/`compile_forward_sim` trusted-three
PRESERVED. The 6 append-crux sorrys (`compatK_handleState`/`Transaction`, `crelK_fund` + `krelS_refl`
state/txn arms) are the ONLY research sorrys `lr_fundamental` depends on.

### BLOCKER on `lr_sound` (ESCALATION — NOT the append crux)

`lr_sound` could NOT be closed by `lr_sound_closed ∘ krelS_refl`. The migration plumbing composes (refocus
`⊑` to config level + `CrelK` unfold + instantiate at observation context `(C,C)`), but the sole remaining
obligation `KrelS fuel B C e C C = krelS_refl` REQUIRES `C` WELL-TYPED at the hole type `B`
(`HasStack C e B eo (F qo Ao)`). The FROZEN `⊑`/`ctxApprox` (LR.lean:64) quantifies over ARBITRARY UNTYPED
`Cxt` — and `KrelS`-reflexivity genuinely FAILS for a context ill-typed at the hole (`letF N :: K'` with
`B ≠ F q A` makes the `KrelS` letF clause FALSE, not vacuous; `lr_sound` is likely even FALSE over untyped
contexts). RESOLUTION (orchestrator decision): (a) restrict `ctxApprox`/`⊑` to well-typed contexts (the
standard contextual-equivalence quantifier — a `ctxApprox` def change), then `lr_sound = lr_sound_closed ∘
krelS_refl` traces to the append crux; or (b) add a `HasStack` hypothesis to `lr_sound` (frozen-statement
change). `lr_sound` left as honest `sorry` with the precise blocker comment at `Spec.lean:188`.

## ◊4.5b-answertrack — the scoped-seam (ADR-0043, branch `cap45-answertrack` off `e755afa`)

The append crux + (g) + the `lr_sound` `HasStack`-typing escalation are ALL CLOSED (in `e755afa`):
`lr_sound`/`lr_fundamental` build green, `sorryAx` traces to EXACTLY ONE spot — `krelS_splitAt_decomp`'s
handleF-MISS (the nested-wrapping-handler edge, `Compat.lean:1474`). This branch scoped that last edge.

### LANDED (`2b4479b`, whole-tree green)
- **`NoWrapMiss : EvalCtx → Label → OpId → Prop`** (`Operational.lean`, after `splitAt`): the dispatch
  reaches its catcher with a handler-free captured continuation. Standalone; kernel/`KrelS` PRISTINE.
- **ADR-0043**: the moat scope. COVERED = all contexts incl. legitimate handler stacking (each op at its
  nearest handler); EXCLUDED narrow = pass-through resumption (op caught by a non-nearest handler).

### WHY sorryAx-ZERO IS DEFERRED (build-pinned, this session) — the EXACT next-session plan

**typed-CrelK necessity — BUILD-PINNED (2026-06-24).** Row-indexed (ii-b) `NoWrapMissRow` on `CrelK`'s
tail threads `crelK_zero`/`adequacy_nil`/`eff_mono` (antitone OK) but WALLS at `crelK_ret`'s two
frame-strips: (1) **letF** (LR.lean ~879) — the continuation runs at row `φ` over `K₁'`, needs `φ ≤ e`
which a RAW `KrelS` lemma lacks → typing required; (2) **handleF** (LR.lean:887) — passing a `ret` through
`handleF h₁` masks `h₁`'s caught ops, so `NoWrapMiss (handleF h₁::K₁') ⊬ NoWrapMiss K₁'` → handler-
interface knowledge required. The row-discharge discriminator is right for the handle-ARM but the scope
dies UPSTREAM in `crelK_ret` first. ⇒ **typed-`CrelK`** (`CrelK` re-indexed by `HasCTy`/`HasStack`) is the
necessary mechanism, threaded through the whole mutual block. Probe (i) corroborates: threads
`krelS_splitAt_decomp` + `crelK_fund_up`, walls at `crelK_fund:1957` (unscoped `CrelK` can't supply the
up-arm premise). (The green partials re-derive cheaply; a fresh (ii) session wants them fresh — no
Context-Rot from a stale mutual-block reshape.)

The MISS-vacuity needs `CrelK` to range only over stacks handling the focus's ops at the nearest handler.
ALL simple stack-scope predicates WALL at one root cause: `crelK_fund`'s handle-arm pushes the focus's OWN
handler (`handle h M` → `M` over `handleF h :: K₁`), violating any runtime-stack scope `P K₁` (need
`P (handleF h :: K₁)`). Build-and-reasoning-confirmed dead: row-indexed `NoWrapMissRow K ε` (walls at
`crelK_ret` letF row-change, no `φ ≤ e` untyped), row-agnostic ∀-ops (walls at `crelK_ret` handleF
handler-masking), fully-`HandlerFree` (walls at the handle-arm push). The `HandlerFree`-ON-the-`KrelS`-clause
variant OVER-FORBIDS (bans legit stacking, breaks `krelS_refl`) — DO NOT re-try it.

**THE CLOSE = a TYPED `CrelK`** (the deferred kernel project, ~pinned-index order of magnitude):
- Re-index `CrelK`'s scope by typing (`HasCTy`/`HasStack`) so it distinguishes the focus's
  legitimately-installed handlers from a pre-existing context wrap — that distinction is what no raw
  stack predicate can make.
- `CrelK`'s body gains the scope premise ⇒ ripples to **every `rw [CrelK]` site** (`LR.lean`:
  `crelK_zero`, `crelK_adequacy_nil`, `CrelK_eff_mono`, `crelK_ret`, `crel_force`, `lr_sound_closed`,
  ~10 sites — each `intro` gains the scope hyp; each APPLICATION supplies it) **+ all Compat compat
  lemmas** (the `hM D (handleF h :: K₁)` applications) **+ the `crelK_fund` mutual block** (WF watch:
  the scope is a non-recursive `Prop` premise, so the `(n,role,stackLen,sizeOf)` metric is unaffected —
  but verify it stays inferring).
- `krelS_splitAt_decomp` takes the typed-scope hyp ⇒ MISS vacuous (via `NoWrapMiss` + the handler-free
  captured continuation it now certifies); `crelK_fund_up` supplies it; `lr_sound`'s `ctxApprox` carries
  the matching premise on the observation context `C` (mirror the #11 `HasStack` premise).
- Frozen-stmt: `lr_sound` + `lr_fundamental` gain the scope premise (STATEMENT_CHANGE_OK, per ADR-0043).
- Do it in a FRESH context (Context-Rot on the ~10-site + Compat reshape). Commit-first per clean lemma;
  flag-before-build at the first `crelK_fund` WF wobble.

### ★ DESIGN-PANEL RECOMMENDATION (2026-06-24, 5-agent A–E panel) — Architecture **D**, supersedes the vacuity framing above

A design panel scored five architectures. **Verdict: pursue D (literature-canonical typed `CrelK` that PROVES the MISS), NOT the A-style vacuity above.** The "MISS-vacuous via scope" framing (lines ~99/117) was REFUTED: legitimate handler stacking is well-typed (state-over-throws is COVERED + tested; the row-discharge premise `e ≤ labelEff ℓ ⊔ φ` discharges each frame's label INDEPENDENTLY and lets a different label survive to a deeper catcher), so typing does **not** forbid the wrap — A only RELOCATES the sorry. Rankings: **D best**; A second (dominated — same typing facts, worse killer, plus a self-inflicted frozen-stmt break); E/B/C dead (E's answer-determinism-FALSE is correct *on raw stacks*; B's refinement can't reach a conjunct *inside* the frozen `KrelS` clause; C's intrinsic-typed Frame breaks inv #1/#4 — the oracle/CalcVM link).

**Why D is the cheaper SOUND close (~3–4 sessions, soundness HIGH):**
1. **PROVE the MISS, don't vacate it.** The sorry's literal obstruction is "`KrelS` does not expose a stack's answer type" (`Compat.lean:1582`). `HasStack K e C eo Co` DOES expose it — the `Co` answer index is carried invariantly to the conclusion of every constructor (`Syntax.lean:247-293`), so it IS the `Stack→CTy` answer-projection the sorry asks for. (E's determinism-FALSE was about a *raw* `Stack→CTy` fn; `HasStack` restores determinacy — this is the GO/NO-GO.)
2. **The forward direction is ALREADY PROVEN unscoped.** `krelS_append`'s nested-`handleF` case (`Compat.lean:1176-1215`, via the krel-carrying `hres_inner` + `dispatchOn_append_outer`) is axiom-clean. The MISS is its **INVERSE** (strip, not append) — a mirror, not a new theorem.
3. **Scope as a PREMISE, not an INDEX → frozen statements survive.** Keeping `abbrev Crel := CrelK` byte-identical preserves the load-bearing `rw [show Crel..=CrelK.. from rfl]` (`Spec.lean:197`). `lr_sound`'s `ctxApprox` ALREADY carries `HasStack` (`LR.lean:77`, the (g) escalation) ⇒ **`lr_sound` needs NO statement change**; only `lr_fundamental` gains the scope premise (STATEMENT_CHANGE_OK). A's re-INDEXING would gratuitously kill the rfl.

**THE GO/NO-GO PROBE (do this FIRST, before any mutual-block reshape):** prove `krelS_strip_handleF` **standalone** (not yet wired into `CrelK`): given `KrelS m (F qᵣ Aᵣ) D' eₛ (Sᵢ ++ handleF h₁::Ko') (Sᵢ' ++ handleF h₂::Ko'')` AND `HasStack (Sᵢ ++ handleF h₁::Ko') eₛ (F qᵣ Aᵣ) eo Co`, conclude `KrelS m (F qᵣ Aᵣ) Dᵢ eₛ Sᵢ Sᵢ'` with `Dᵢ` read off the `HasStack` at the `Sᵢ`/`handleF` junction. Induct on `Sᵢ` MIRRORING `krelS_append` in reverse. **KILLER OBLIGATION (gate the whole multi-session commit on it):** in the `handleF`-in-`Sᵢ` sub-case, invert `HasStack` at the append point to get `HasStack Sᵢ eₛ (F qᵣ Aᵣ) D̂ Co` and prove `D̂ = Dᵢ` (the split-point hole `krelS_splitAt_decomp`'s `ih` threads). If `HasStack`'s indices make the junction answer SYNTACTICALLY determined → **D is GO**; if the `KrelS.letF` existential `B` leaks through despite typing → **D is NO-GO and the ADR-0043 seam is FINAL** (do not spend the sessions).

**Step sequence (after the probe is green):** (1) `krelS_strip_handleF` standalone, axiom-gated. (2) discharge the `Compat.lean:1474/1590` MISS using it + `dispatchOn_append_outer` + existing `hres` (add the typed-scope param to `krelS_splitAt_decomp` locally first). (3) ONLY THEN thread the `HasStack` scope as a **PREMISE** through `CrelK`'s body (~10 `rw[CrelK]` sites) — NOT an index. (4) thread the Compat compat lemmas + `crelK_fund` handle/up arms (supply scope from the focus typing at the `handle h M` push). (5) `lr_fundamental` gains the premise; `lr_sound` UNCHANGED.

**Open risks (carry into the session):** (a) **KrelS sub-ripple** — the sorry is a conjunct INSIDE the `KrelS` handleF clause (`LR.lean:527-555`), so the scope may need threading into `KrelS`'s recursion, not just `CrelK`'s body; KEEP it a premise on the consuming LEMMAS, not the `KrelS` DEFINITION, or the abbrev/simp-lemma signatures break and the cost balloons toward A's 4–7. (b) **junction determinism** (the killer, above) — UNVERIFIED until the probe runs. (c) **WF re-inference** — `HasStack` is an erased `Prop` premise so the `(n,role,stackLen,sizeOf)` metric is unaffected *provided* tail-`HasStack` inversions happen OUTSIDE recursive calls; flag-before-build at the first wobble. (d) **`crelK_fund` handle-arm scope-supply** — verify `HasStack.handleF/stateF/transactionF` construct cleanly from the `handle`-rule premises (this is the `crelK_fund:1957` up-arm wall). (e) **stateF/transactionF inversion friction** — heavy interface premises; `dispatch_state_typed` (`Metatheory.lean:2017`) does analogous inversions.

## Discipline (carried)
Build is the only arbiter; gate the AXIOM SET each commit (`lake env lean Bang/Audit.lean`) AND on a
WHOLE-TREE `lake build` (never a per-module build — that gives false-green). flag-before-build the
scope-thread WF. Shared git store had a broken cache-tree — recover per-worktree via `git read-tree HEAD`
(do NOT gc/prune the shared store; other writers active). The pre-commit `just verify` reclones loogle
(network-flaky); `--no-verify` with `BANGLANG_SKIP_VERIFY_REASON` is OK for that, but run the whole-tree
build manually before declaring green.
