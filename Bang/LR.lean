/-! ## 5. Observational equivalence — `≈` is the spec notion of equality -/

-- §6 recovery algebra (used by recovery theorems in Spec.lean). The
-- `(seqComp, idComp, recover)` triple is the monoid/group structure on
-- computations from ADR-0018's Trinity table (`monoid ⇒ sequencing w/ identity`,
-- `group ⇒ rollback`). Concretized from the kernel's `Comp`, not hand-axiomatized.

/-- Sequencing (the monoid multiplication): run `c₁`, DISCARD its value, run `c₂`.
`Comp.shift c₂` lifts `c₂` over the `letC` binder so it ignores index 0 — this is
`c₁ ; c₂` (Biernacki/CBPV `let _ = c₁ in c₂`). With `idComp` (`ret unit`) it forms
a monoid: `seqComp (ret v) c` head-reduces `letC (ret v) (shift c) ↦ (shift c)[v] = c`
(subst-after-shift is the identity), which is exactly `seq_unit`'s LEFT-unit law. -/
def seqComp (c₁ c₂ : Comp) : Comp := Comp.letC c₁ (Comp.shift c₂)

/-- The monoid unit / identity computation: the pure no-op `ret ()`. -/
def idComp : Comp := Comp.ret Val.vunit

/-- Recovery (the group inverse, ADR-0018 `group ⇒ rollback`). The recovery
SCAFFOLD is the identity computation; the rollback CONTENT (`seqComp c (recover c) ≈
idComp`) is delivered by the `[AddGroup Eff]` group structure in `group_recovers`'s
proof, NOT by an inverse-effect TERM. Materializing an inverse as a `Comp` would need
either group-effect operations the kernel does not have or a 6th primitive (invariant
#5) — so the honest faithful def keeps the scaffold pure and lets the relation carry
the inversion. See FORK note in the report; revisit when group effects get term-level
operations. -/
def recover (_c : Comp) : Comp := idComp

-- Computation-to-computation contexts (for ctxApprox). SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
-- (CLAUDE.md invariant): the kernel's CK frame stack `EvalCtx` with its `plug`
-- (`Bang/Operational.lean`) IS Biernacki's evaluation-context notion `ECont`/`E[·]`
-- (popl18 §3 Fig 1). `ctxApprox`/`ctxEquiv` quantify over these. `EvalCtx` is the
-- typed object `HasStack` (Syntax.lean §1.7) is already a judgement over, so reusing
-- it (rather than a parallel `Cxt`) keeps one context algebra everywhere.

/-! ### 5.0b `NotEvaluated` — the coeffect-erasure notion (`zero_usage_erasable`)

`NotEvaluated i c`: the de Bruijn index `i`'s binder is never EVALUATED in `c` — i.e. WHAT is
substituted at index `i` cannot affect `c`'s observable behaviour. The faithful notion is SEMANTIC,
not structural: a 0-graded variable is still substituted syntactically and still type-checks (QTT
permits 0-graded occurrences, e.g. `ret (vvar 0)` at returner grade `q = 0`), so "index `i` doesn't
occur" is FALSE — only its *evaluation* is absent. We phrase that as observational
substitution-irrelevance: every two fillers produce `≈`-equivalent computations. This is exactly
Torczon's grade-0 erasure (`semtyping.v`), which is proved via the logical relation. -/
def NotEvaluated (i : Nat) (c : Comp) : Prop :=
  ∀ v₁ v₂ : Val, Comp.substFrom i v₁ c ≈ Comp.substFrom i v₂ c


/-! ### 5.0a Plug/run bridge + `seq_unit` (the left-unit head reduction)

`seq_unit` is purely OPERATIONAL — no LR machinery. `seqComp (ret v) c = letC (ret v) (shift c)`
head-reduces to `c` in TWO machine steps (`letC (ret v) N ↦ N[v]`, then `(shift c)[v] = c` by
`Comp.subst_shift`), and this holds in EVERY context. The bridge `run_plug` says loading a
`plug C x` term reaches the focused config `(C, x)` after `C.length` push steps, which lets the
context-quantified `ctxEquiv` reduce to a config-level co-convergence. -/

/-- Loading `plug C c` and running it equals running the focused config `(C, c)`, modulo the
`C.length` push steps that re-decompose `plug C c` back into the frame stack `C`. The machine
PUSHes through each `letC/app/handle` node the `plug` built (those nodes always PUSH, regardless of
the subterm), rebuilding `C` innermost-first. -/

shape: biernacki-popl18 §3 Fig 1 (`ECont`), §5.1 Figs 6–9 (Vrel/Srel/Krel/Crel domains). -/

-- The LR's stack/continuation domain (Biernacki Krel domain `K⟦·⟧`, popl18 §5.1
-- Fig 7). SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: this is the same evaluation-context notion as `Cxt`
-- — the kernel's CK frame stack — so `Stack` reuses `EvalCtx` and `Stack.plug` reuses
-- `plug`. (Biernacki keeps one `ECont` grammar across the operational semantics and
-- the LR; we likewise keep one `EvalCtx`.)

def Stack.plug (K : Stack) (c : Comp) : Comp := Bang.plug K c

/-- Base-type value relation (Biernacki `⟦τ⟧` restricted to base types, popl18 §5.1
Fig 6). At base types the relation is SYNTACTIC value identity — `unit`/`int` carry no
latent computation, so observably-equal base values are equal values. Non-base types
(`U`/`sum`/`prod`/`mu`) relate through `Vrel` (the step-indexed LR proper, Unit 2), so
`BaseRel` is `False` there: it is the BASE case the inductive `Vrel` bottoms out in,
not a relation over all types. -/
def BaseRel {Eff Mult : Type} (A : VTy Eff Mult) (v₁ v₂ : Val) : Prop :=
  match A with
  | .unit => v₁ = Val.vunit ∧ v₂ = Val.vunit
  | .int  => ∃ n : Int, v₁ = Val.vint n ∧ v₂ = Val.vint n
  | _     => False

/-- Base-type stack relation (Biernacki Krel `K⟦τ/ε⟧` at base answer types, popl18 §5.1
Fig 7). Two stacks relate at index `n` and a base RETURNER type `F q A` when, plugged
with `BaseRel`-related values, they co-converge within the step budget — the
biorthogonal "observe through related values" clause specialized to base answers. At
non-returner answer types it is `False` (the base case for `Krel`, Unit 2). The index
threads Biernacki's `▷` (later) budget. -/
def BaseStackRel {Eff Mult : Type} [Lattice Eff] [OrderBot Eff]

        CoApprox (Stack.plug K₁ (Comp.ret v₁)) (Stack.plug K₂ (Comp.ret v₂))
  | .arr _ _ _ => False

/-- CBPV thunk destructor (Biernacki §5.1 coercion: read a suspended computation type
out of a value type). `U φ B` is the thunk of a `φ`-effectful `B`; everything else is
not a thunk. The LR uses this to know when a value is a thunk it must relate at `B`. -/

  | .U φ B => some (φ, B)
  | _      => none

/-- CBPV returner destructor (Biernacki §5.1 coercion: read the produced value type out
of a computation type). `F q A` returns an `A` at multiplicity `q`; an `arr` does not
return, so `none`. The LR uses this to know when a computation produces a value to
relate at `A`. -/
def asReturner {Eff Mult : Type} : CTy Eff Mult → Option (Mult × VTy Eff Mult)
  | .F q A => some (q, A)

/-- Embed an operation as a computation that raises effect `ℓ` with payload `v`
(Biernacki §5.1 `op_l v`; our zero-shot `throws` operation, ADR-0022/0023). FORK from
the frozen axiom: the old signature `raise : Eff → Val → Comp` took an opaque lattice
`Eff` element, from which NO concrete `Label` can be extracted to feed `up` — it could
not have been inhabited faithfully. The faithful type is `Label → Val → Comp`
(`Label = Nat`, the concrete operation channel `up` consumes). -/
def raise (ℓ : Label) (v : Val) : Comp := Comp.up ℓ "raise" v
-- operation arg/result types: superseded by `EffSig.opArg`/`opRes` (ADR-0022 D1),
-- which are per-`(Label, OpId)` (the old per-`Eff` axioms could not type `get` vs `put`).


/-! ## 5.2 LR — Vrel / Srel / Krel / Crel

The four step-indexed logical relations, transcribed clause-by-clause from
Biernacki popl18 Figs 6–9 (`references/papers/3-lr/`) onto OUR kernel
(`Comp`/`Val`/`CTy`/`VTy`/`EvalCtx`), specialized to set-rows.

shape: §5.2 / Figs 6–9 —
```
  Vrel n A v₁ v₂            ⟺  ⟦A⟧η          (Fig 6 value interpretation)
  Crel n C ε c₁ c₂          ⟺  E⟦C/ε⟧η       (Fig 7 biorthogonal computation closure)
  Krel n C ε K₁ K₂          ⟺  K⟦C/ε⟧η       (Fig 7 evaluation-context relation)
  Srel n C ε K₁ K₂ c₁ c₂    ⟺  S⟦C/ε⟧η       (Fig 7 control-stuck / "simple expr" relation)
```
`Obs` is our `CoApprox` (fuel-bounded co-convergence; no extra index — `Converges`
already iterates fuel). η (the row-variable interpretation) is absent: our rows are
CLOSED `Finset Label`, not polymorphic (ADR-0027, no row variables).

FROZEN-SIGNATURE FIX (Option C, lead-authorized STATEMENT_CHANGE): Biernacki indexes
every COMPUTATION-level relation by `τ/ε` (type AND row). Our kernel keeps the row
SEPARATE from `CTy` (`HasCTy γ Γ c e B` synthesizes `e : Eff` independently — `letC`
joins `φ₁⊔φ₂`, `up` produces `φ`; `e` is NOT a function of `(c,B)`), and the row is
load-bearing in `Srel` (the `labelEff ℓ ≤ ε` clause). So the Phase-A 2-arg `Crel`/`Krel`
(and ε-only `Srel`) stubs were UNDER-SPECIFIED — the faithful relations gain the `Eff`
row argument. `Vrel` stays 4-arg: value types carry their rows internally at `U φ B`.
(Mirror of U1's `raise` fix: a frozen stub that couldn't be inhabited faithfully.) The
ambient `[EffSig Eff Mult]` is needed to type op args/results (`opArg`/`opRes`) and the
label's singleton row (`labelEff`); `Spec.lean` already carries it in scope.

SET-ROW SPECIALIZATION (Biernacki §5.4): with disjoint set-rows the ρ-maps of the
effect-row interpretation VANISH and `ρᵢ-free(Eᵢ)` collapses to "`Eᵢ` does not handle ℓ"
— here `splitAt K ℓ op = none`. (ADR-0001 rows-as-sets is exactly the Hillerström–Lindley
regime §5.4 shows licenses this.)

WELL-FOUNDEDNESS: the mutual block terminates by a lex measure `(n, sizeOf type, role)`
(Ahmed-style step index; ahmed-esop06 / proving-correctness-step-indexed). The `role`
(Vrel 3 > Crel 2 > Krel 1 > Srel 0) orders the four relations WITHIN one `(n, type)`, so
the biorthogonal `Crel → Krel → Srel` cycle (all at the same `(n,C)`) strictly decreases.
`n` drops (Biernacki's `▷` later modality) on the only two index-decreasing edges: `Vrel`
at `mu` (guarded recursion on the unrolled type) and `Srel`'s output clause back into
`Crel`. `Vrel` at `U φ B` descends to `Crel B` on the strictly smaller type. No iris-lean
`▷` encoding needed — the plain lex order goes through (`decreasing_by` auto-discharged). -/

mutual
/-- Value relation `⟦A⟧η` (Biernacki Fig 6), our `VTy`. Base types bottom out in
`BaseRel` (syntactic identity). `U φ B` (the CBPV thunk, our analogue of the arrow
`τ₁ →ε τ₂` value) relates two thunks iff their forced computations are `Crel`-related at
`B` under the thunk's row `φ`. ADT formers relate structurally (`sum`/`prod` at the
sub-types). `mu` is GUARDED: at `n+1` two `fold`s relate iff their payloads relate at the
unrolled type `A[μX.A/X]` at index `n` (the `▷` step that makes the recursion well-founded;
`Vrel 0 (mu _)` is vacuously `True`). `tvar` is `False` (closed types: a bare recursion
var is never reached — `unrollMu` substitutes it away at each `mu` step). -/

The fundamental theorem `lr_fundamental` (ADR-0034 env-closed form) relates an OPEN computation to
itself under a pair of `Vrel`-RELATED substitution environments. The bare `c c` self-relation is
UNPROVABLE for an open `c`: a free `vvar i` is not `Vrel`-related to itself (`Vrel n unit (vvar 0)
(vvar 0)` demands `vvar 0 = vunit`), and the induction over `HasCTy` descends under binders into open
sub-terms. So the faithful invariant closes `c` over related environments δ₁,δ₂ (Biernacki/Ahmed
`G⟦Γ⟧`):

  shape: biernacki-popl18 §5.2 fundamental theorem (`G⟦Γ⟧η`); ahmed-esop06 closing substitution.

An environment is a `List Val` of CLOSED fillers (the CK focus is always closed). Applying it
(`closeC`) folds single `Comp.subst`s, innermost binder (index 0) first. These live HERE (not in
`Compat.lean`) because the FROZEN `lr_fundamental` statement (`Spec.lean`) references them, and
`Spec.lean` imports `LR` but not `Compat`. -/

/-- Apply a closing environment δ to a computation: substitute index 0 with `δ[0]` (renumbering),
then recurse on the tail (each `Comp.subst` removes the nearest binder). `closeC [] c = c`. -/

/-! ## 5.3 Adequacy building blocks toward `lr_sound`

`lr_sound : (∀ n, Crel n B e c₁ c₂) → c₁ ⊑ c₂`. Biorthogonal adequacy
(benton-hur-icfp09, pitts-step-indexed): `Crel` co-behaves against EVERY
`Krel`-related stack pair, so instantiating at a stack pair `(C, C)` known to be
`Krel`-self-related yields the `⊑`-clause for context `C`.

The CLOSED case (`C = []`) is provable from the relations ALONE — `krel_nil`
below — and gives `lr_sound_closed` (empty-context / whole-program adequacy). The
ARBITRARY-context case needs `Krel n B e C C` for every `C`, i.e. Krel-reflexivity
(the "identity extension" lemma), which is the FUNDAMENTAL-THEOREM direction — see
the dependency note on `lr_sound` in `Bang/Spec.lean`. -/

/-- The empty stack is `Krel`-self-related at every SUCCESSOR index/type/row: the RETURN half
holds because `ret v` always converges (so `CoApprox` is `True → True`), and the STUCK half
holds because an `Srel (n+1)`-pair under `[]` is an unhandled `up`, which never converges (so
`CoApprox` is `False → _`). This is the closed-program observation context.

The `n+1` is necessary: at index 0, `Srel 0 = True` carries no operation shape, so the stuck
half would demand `CoApprox c₁ c₂` for ARBITRARY `c₁ c₂` — false. (This is the standard
step-indexed convention that a relation-as-PREMISE is only informative at successor indices;
the `∀ n` hypothesis of `lr_sound` lets the proof pick `n+1`.) -/
