# CalcVM — the ◊3 graded-CBPV calculated machine (pure CBPV spine)

The Bahr–Hutton calculation (ADR-0016, ADR-0017; invariant #4) ported ONCE to
the new graded-CBPV `Comp`/`Val` (`Bang.Core`), replacing the K2 `Calc*.lean`
matrix over the old free-monad `Expr`/`Value`.

This file lands the **pure CBPV spine** (`ret` · `letC` · `force`/`vthunk` ·
`lam` · `app`) PLUS **deep-handler INSTALL** (`handle`) — the calculated machine,
`compile_correct`, AND the **`evalD ≡ Source.eval` bridge** (D1-A) over all of it.
The handler **abort/dispatch** (an `up` raising to its handler, the THROW-jump) is
sub-step 2. The ADT eliminators are calculated too: `case`/`split` defer to runtime
`CASE`/`SPLIT` instructions (their erasure `compile (subst …)` is non-structural, so
they re-`compile` the branch under fuel exactly as `SUBST`/`APP` do), while
`unfold (fold v)` ERASES at compile time onto `RET v` (structural — like
`force (vthunk M) ↦ compile M`; no dedicated instruction, invariant #4).
ADR-0031 (resumptive state) adds the store thread:
`evalD` services `get`/`put` inline, the machine RESUMES with a non-discarding `OP`,
and the `compile_correct` (`sim`) + `evalD ≡ Source.eval` (`run_evalD`) proofs are
both axiom-clean over the WHOLE state-resuming semantics — no `sorry`. The throws⊗state
nesting (an outer `put` before a caught inner raise) is handled: the abort keeps the
outer put (evalD-caught = the at-raise store `σ'`, machine-faithful).

### Effects: two-part `Outcome` + (A) explicit HANDLE-frame (throws-only, D2)

`evalD` returns an `Outcome` = `term` (normal terminal) | `raised` (an `up` en
route to its handler) — the denotational big-step exception shape (k2-playbook
§Effects); `letC`/`app` short-circuit on `raised`, `handle` catches it. The
machine installs handlers with explicit **`MARK`/`UNMARK` frames** (shape (A),
chosen over (B) defunctionalized continuations): throws are zero-shot (abort
DISCARDS the continuation), so (B)'s resumption capture is unused — `MARK` is a
THROW-jump target, mirroring the kernel's `splitAt`/`dispatch`, which keeps the
bridge's `up` case a tight `THROW ↔ dispatch` correspondence. (A) is the
**throws-only shape, not the final one**: resumptive handlers (state-resume
ADR-0025, multi-shot ADR-0015) — the reification frontier — will need (B) when
the machine must capture/resume a continuation. This sub-step lands INSTALL only:
`MARK`/`UNMARK` are identity on a normal return (handler-return = identity, Q6).

## Design lock: substitution / closed-focus, mirroring the kernel (option b)

The kernel's own machine `Source.step` (`Bang/Operational.lean`) is
**substitution-based with a CLOSED focus** — there is NO environment and NO
closure: `force (vthunk M) ↦ M`, `letC`/`app` reduce by `Comp.subst`. We mirror
it. So `evalD` here is substitution-based (NOT the env-based K2 `Calc.lean`
shape), which (a) keeps the machine kernel-faithful (invariant #1 — rides the
reference) and (b) makes the future `evalD ≡ Source.eval` bridge nearly
mechanical (subst-vs-subst, only a big/small-step gap), which is the whole point
of D1-A (type-safety inheritance).

**CBPV wrinkle:** `evalD` returns a *terminal computation* `Option Comp`
(`ret v` OR `lam M`), not `Option Val` — a function-typed computation reduces to
`lam`, which is a `Comp`, not a value. `app M v` runs `M` to a `lam N` then
β-substitutes; `letC M N` runs `M` to a `ret v` then substitutes.

## DEFERRED (a later calculation increment, NOT abandoned)

This is the RIGHT FIRST STAGE, a CK-style machine: its `SUBST`/`APP` instructions
carry a *residual `Comp`* and re-`compile` `N[v]` at runtime, so the machine is
NOT yet "flat" (no numeric-only stack). A FURTHER calculation step —
**defunctionalize the frames + compile substitution away** — flattens it toward a
real numeric-stack VM / the WasmFX target. Invariant #7 (perf second-class) backs
staging that AFTER the spine is feature-complete (force/lam/app/effects). Do not
lose the flat-machine goal; it is the next-but-one increment.

## What the calculation forces into existence

Posit, forward to a concrete result (the fuel-alignment key, k2-playbook §1):

    evalD n M = some t  →  exec F c (t :: s) = some r  →  ∃ F', exec F' (compile M c) s = some r   (★)

and compute by induction on the eval fuel `n`. Each constructor forces an
instruction; `{RET, LAMI, SUBST, APP}` is the OUTPUT, never hand-designed
(invariant #4). Fuel monotonicity (`exec_mono`) bumps sub-fuels to a common
value. `compile_correct` is the `c = []`, `s = []` corollary, **proven** below.

/-! ## The state store (ADR-0031 D1): a 1:1 mirror of the active `state ℓ s` frames

`SStore` is the resumptive mechanism `evalD` threads (ADR-0031 D1). It is a **stack** of
`(label ↦ value)` bindings that mirrors the machine's active `state ℓ s` frames **1:1, in order**
(D3): `handle (state ℓ s) M` PUSHES `(ℓ, s)` for the dynamic extent of `M` and POPS it on exit;
`get` reads the nearest binding for `ℓ`; `put` UPDATES the nearest binding **in place** (NOT a
prepend — this exactly mirrors the machine's in-place `stateUpdate` on the HStack, so the store and
the HStack-state-projection stay structurally identical, which is what makes the bridge invariant a
direct correspondence rather than a representation translation). `∉ store` ⟺ no active `state`
frame for `ℓ` ⟹ the op propagates as a throws-path `raised`. -/

/-! ## The transaction heap store (ADR-0031 D4): the list-heap analog of `SStore`

`THeap` is the resumptive mechanism `evalD` threads for **transaction** frames — `SStore`
generalized from a single `Val` cell to a list-heap `List Val` (the TVar store, ADR-0030).
It mirrors the machine's active `transaction ℓ Θ` frames 1:1, in order, exactly as `SStore`
mirrors `state ℓ s` frames.

**INVARIANT (op-disjointness — the load-bearing correctness argument).** This is a SEPARATE
parallel store from `SStore`, NOT a unified `List (Label × Cell)`, because state ops
`{get,put}` are op-disjoint from transaction ops `{newTVar,readTVar,writeTVar}` (`handlesOp`,
`Operational.lean`). `splitAt` finds the nearest frame *catching `(ℓ,op)`*, gated on op-id —
so a label shared across both a `state` and a `transaction` frame still resolves
UNAMBIGUOUSLY by op-id, and within-kind shadowing (nearest state frame for `get`; nearest
txn frame for `readTVar`) is all that each per-projection order must preserve. The two
projections never cross. A unified store would add structure to enforce an invariant that is
ALREADY structural via op-disjointness — the inverse of correctness-by-construction.

**INVARIANT (soundness boundary).** This parallel rep is sound ONLY while the state and
transaction op-sets stay disjoint. Adding an op handled by BOTH kinds would reintroduce
cross-kind ambiguity (a label could resolve to either projection) — re-examine the rep
(unify into one ordered store) BEFORE doing so. -/

/-! ## The denotational source `evalD` (substitution, terminal-Comp, store-threaded)

Fuel-bounded, structurally recursive on the fuel (NO `termination_by`, so the
equations unfold under `simp`/`rw`; k2-playbook §3). `none` = stuck / out-of-fuel
/ out-of-scope (the partiality ⊥). `ret`/`lam` are terminal; `letC`/`app` sequence
through a sub-eval and substitute; `force (vthunk M)` runs the (closed) body.

**ADR-0031 D1 (store-thread):** `evalD` threads an `SStore` in and out. State ops
(`get`/`put` on a label with an active `state` frame) are serviced **inline** — they
never escape as `raised` — which is what dissolves the big-step "no continuation to
resume" difficulty: state is serviced *during* the recursive descent. `raised` is
**reserved for throws** after this ADR (D1). -/
/-- A computation's big-step result: a normal `term`inal computation (`ret v` |
`lam M`), OR a `raised` operation propagating outward toward its handler. After
ADR-0031, `raised` is the THROWS dimension only — state `get`/`put` are serviced
inline against the store and yield a `term`. `letC`/`app` short-circuit on `raised`;
a `throws` `handle` catches it. -/

Each `evalD` clause forces an instruction (computing the RHS of (★)):

* `ret v`  → `RET v`  : push the terminal `ret v`.
* `lam M`  → `LAMI M` : push the terminal `lam M`.
* `letC M N` → `compile M (SUBST N :: c)`: run `M`; `SUBST N` pops its `ret v`,
  then runs `N[v]` (re-`compile`d) before `c`.
* `force (vthunk M)` → `compile M c`: forcing a thunk just runs its closed body —
  no instruction; the calculation collapses it.
* `app M v` → `compile M (APP v :: c)`: run `M`; `APP v` pops its `lam N`, runs
  `N[v]`.

`hsState hs ℓ` reads the nearest `state ℓ` frame's stored value out of the machine's
HStack — the machine-side mirror of `evalD`'s `SStore.get?`. `Corr σ hs` is the
bridge invariant: the denotational store agrees with the machine's active state
frames at every label. The two lemmas below relate `stateUpdate` (the machine's
in-place service) to `SStore.get?`/`SStore.put` (the store's), so the `sim` `up`/
`handle (state)` cases close by a direct correspondence (D3), not a representation
translation. -/

A returning body's net effect on the HStack is to mutate **state-frame values in place**, never
to push/pop or change a frame's `savedCode`/`savedStack`/handler-shape. `HMut hs hsf` captures
exactly that: same length, frame-by-frame the `savedCode`/`savedStack` agree and the handlers agree
up to a `state` frame's stored value. This is the invariant that lets the `handle` term cases pop
the installed frame and recover `Corr` on the tail (the frame the body kept is structurally the one
that was installed). -/

/-- Two frames agree up to a `state` handler's stored value OR a `transaction` handler's stored

/-- (★) the **two-part, store-threaded** simulation (k2-playbook §Effects + ADR-0031):
a `term` part AND a `raised` part. The store-thread is the resume mechanism — the
`term` part is now an EXISTENTIAL over the machine's resulting HStack `hsf` (M
transforms `hs ↝ hsf`, the continuation `c` runs from `hsf`), with `Corr σ' hsf`
(the store mirrors the machine's active state frames, D3). The `up`/`handle (state)`
cases use `stateUpdate_get`/`stateUpdate_put`/`Corr_install` to align the inline
store service with the in-place HStack update. The `handle (throws)` catch is the
zero-shot `THROW ↔ dispatch` correspondence (now σ-threaded).

/-! ## The ◊3 diff-test battery — `exec ∘ compile ≡ Source.eval` on a curated program set

The ROADMAP-named ◊3 gate artifact (ADR-0017 / PATH-calcvm-port D3). `compile_correct`
+ `evalD_agrees_source` already PROVE this equality *in general*; this curated battery
is the concrete cross-check that catches definitional drift and DOCUMENTS coverage of
all five feature axes. Curated, not a fuzzer (a generator is a deferred nice-to-have).

The honesty discipline: each case asserts agreement on the **observable value** via
`Agree` — the calculated machine (`exec ∘ compile`, yielding `Option Stack` with the
terminal `ret v` on the stack) and the type-safety-verified kernel (`Source.eval`,
yielding `Result Val`) both produce the SAME `Val v`. Tying both reps to a single `v`
makes a false "they agree" structurally unrepresentable — you cannot satisfy `Agree`
by having the two sides return *different* values. Every case closes by `rfl`
(empirically: the curated programs reduce symbolically, so no `native_decide` and
hence no `Lean.ofReduceBool` in the axiom set — the battery stays axiom-clean). The
empty stores `σ=[]`/`τ=[]` and empty `HStack`/`EvalCtx` mirror the closed-program load.

Coverage (the five axes; a `#guard`-style build failure = a red gate, so green = passing):
  · PURE        — let / app / force·thunk
  · THROWS      — caught raise (`Agree`) + UNCAUGHT raise (no value; asserted separately)
  · STATE       — get-default / put-then-get / outer-put-persists-past-a-caught-throw
  · TRANSACTION — new+read (heap thread) + abort-rollback (write discarded on foreign throw)
  · ADT         — case·inl / case·inr / split / unfold -/

/-- End-to-end agreement at one observable value: the calculated machine
(`exec ∘ compile`) and the kernel reference (`Source.eval`) both yield the SAME
`Val v`. The shared `v` is what makes a false "agree" unrepresentable. -/

-- ─── PURE axis (let / app / force) ───────────────────────────────────────────

/-- `(λ. ret #0) 5` ⇒ `5` — β through `LAMI`/`APP`. -/
example : Agree 12 (.app (.lam (.ret (.vvar 0))) (.vint 5)) (.vint 5) := ⟨by rfl, by rfl⟩

/-- `let x = (λ.ret #0) 5 in ret x` ⇒ `5` — `SUBST` over an applied lambda. -/
example : Agree 16 (.letC (.app (.lam (.ret (.vvar 0))) (.vint 5)) (.ret (.vvar 0))) (.vint 5) :=
  ⟨by rfl, by rfl⟩

/-- `force (thunk (ret 9))` ⇒ `9` — `force`∘`vthunk` collapses to the body. -/
example : Agree 12 (.force (.vthunk (.ret (.vint 9)))) (.vint 9) := ⟨by rfl, by rfl⟩

-- ─── THROWS axis (caught + uncaught) ─────────────────────────────────────────

/-- `handle (throws ℓ) (raise 7)` ⇒ `7` — the deep handler catches and aborts with the payload. -/
example : Agree 20 (.handle (.throws 0) (.perform 0 0 "raise" (.vint 7))) (.vint 7) := ⟨by rfl, by rfl⟩

/-- DEEP throws: `handle (throws ℓ) (let _ = raise 7 in 99)` ⇒ `7` — the handler reaches PAST a
`letF` frame and DISCARDS the captured continuation (`99` is never returned). -/
example : Agree 24 (.handle (.throws 0) (.letC (.perform 0 0 "raise" (.vint 7)) (.ret (.vint 99)))) (.vint 7) :=
  ⟨by rfl, by rfl⟩

/-- UNCAUGHT `raise` (no handler in scope) yields NO observable value — so it falls OUTSIDE
`Agree`. Both reps signal it: the machine gets STUCK (`exec = none`), the kernel returns
`.stuck`. The axis is covered by asserting that shared stuckness (not a value agreement). -/
example : exec 20 (compile (.perform 0 0 "raise" (.vint 7)) []) [] [] = none := by rfl
example : Source.eval 20 (Comp.perform 0 0 "raise" (.vint 7)) = .stuck := by rfl

-- ─── STATE axis (get-default / put-then-get / persist-past-caught-throw) ──────

/-- `handle (state ℓ 5) (get ())` ⇒ `5` — read the initial state. -/
example : Agree 40 (.handle (.state 1 (.vint 5)) (.perform 0 1 "get" .vunit)) (.vint 5) := ⟨by rfl, by rfl⟩

/-- `handle (state ℓ 0) (let _ = put 7 in get ())` ⇒ `7` — the RESUMPTIVE handler KEEPS the captured
`letF` continuation and threads the store; `get` reads the `put`. -/
example : Agree 80
    (.handle (.state 1 (.vint 0)) (.letC (.perform 0 1 "put" (.vint 7)) (.perform 0 1 "get" .vunit)))
    (.vint 7) := ⟨by rfl, by rfl⟩

/-- OUTER STATE PERSISTS PAST A CAUGHT THROW: `handle (state ℓ 0) (put 7; handle (throws) (raise);
get)` ⇒ `7`. The inner zero-shot throw is caught and discarded, but the outer resumptive store
survives — `get` still sees the `put 7`. The interaction the resumptive/zero-shot split must get right. -/
example : Agree 100
    (.handle (.state 1 (.vint 0))
      (.letC (.perform 0 1 "put" (.vint 7))
        (.letC (.handle (.throws 0) (.perform 0 0 "raise" .vunit))
          (.perform 0 1 "get" .vunit))))
    (.vint 7) := ⟨by rfl, by rfl⟩

-- ─── TRANSACTION axis (new+read heap-thread / abort-rollback) ─────────────────

/-- `handle (transaction ℓ []) (newTVar 9; readTVar 0)` ⇒ `9` — allocate then read back; the heap
threads through both ops (ADR-0031 D4). -/
example : Agree 40
    (.handle (.transaction 2 []) (.letC (.perform 0 2 "newTVar" (.vint 9)) (.perform 0 2 "readTVar" (.vvar 0))))
    (.vint 9) := ⟨by rfl, by rfl⟩

/-- ABORT-ROLLBACK: an outer `throws` wraps `transaction (newTVar 100; writeTVar 0:=70; raise 100)`.
The `raise` is FOREIGN to the transaction frame, so it escapes it (zero-shot) — the threaded heap with
the `writeTVar 70` is DISCARDED with the frame (never commits). The abort payload `100` is the ORIGINAL
balance, the observable proof the write rolled back. -/
example : Agree 80
    (.handle (.throws 0)
      (.handle (.transaction 2 [])
        (.letC (.perform 0 2 "newTVar" (.vint 100))
          (.letC (.perform 0 2 "writeTVar" (.pair (.vint 0) (.vint 70)))
            (.perform 0 0 "raise" (.vint 100))))))
    (.vint 100) := ⟨by rfl, by rfl⟩

-- ─── ADT axis (case·inl / case·inr / split / unfold) ─────────────────────────
-- `CASE`/`SPLIT` reduce a closed-value scrutinee at runtime; `unfold` ERASES at compile time onto
-- `RET` (like `force∘vthunk`). Both reps agree on the observable value.

/-- `case (inl 5) (ret #0) (ret 99)` ⇒ `5` — sum elim, LEFT branch binds the payload. -/
example : Agree 12 (.case (.inl (.vint 5)) (.ret (.vvar 0)) (.ret (.vint 99))) (.vint 5) :=
  ⟨by rfl, by rfl⟩

/-- `case (inr 7) (ret 99) (ret #0)` ⇒ `7` — sum elim, RIGHT branch. -/
example : Agree 12 (.case (.inr (.vint 7)) (.ret (.vint 99)) (.ret (.vvar 0))) (.vint 7) :=
  ⟨by rfl, by rfl⟩

/-- `split (pair 3 4) (ret #1)` ⇒ `3` — product elim. The DOUBLE subst binds `v=3` at #1 and `w=4`
(shifted) at #0; `ret #1` selects the first component. -/
example : Agree 14 (.split (.pair (.vint 3) (.vint 4)) (.ret (.vvar 1))) (.vint 3) := ⟨by rfl, by rfl⟩

/-- `unfold (fold 8)` ⇒ `8` — μ elim: fold/unfold erase. -/
example : Agree 12 (.unfold (.fold (.vint 8))) (.vint 8) := ⟨by rfl, by rfl⟩

-- The intermediate `evalD` rep agrees too (it sits between the two `Agree` sides): a sample across
-- the ADT axis, documenting that the substitution `evalD` calculated-from is itself faithful.
example : evalD 12 [] [] (.case (.inl (.vint 5)) (.ret (.vvar 0)) (.ret (.vint 99)))
    = some (.term (.ret (.vint 5)), [], []) := by rfl
example : evalD 14 [] [] (.split (.pair (.vint 3) (.vint 4)) (.ret (.vvar 1)))
    = some (.term (.ret (.vint 3)), [], []) := by rfl
example : evalD 12 [] [] (.unfold (.fold (.vint 8)))
    = some (.term (.ret (.vint 8)), [], []) := by rfl

/-! ## The D1-A bridge: `evalD ≡ Source.eval` (two-part, with handlers)

`run_evalD` is the **two-part** big/small-step simulation: a `term` part (M runs to
its terminal under context `K`) AND a `raised` part (M raises an op the kernel
`dispatch`es — the `THROW ↔ dispatch` correspondence). Subst-vs-subst ⇒ a plain
simulation, no cross-rep logical relation (the (b) payoff). `evalD_agrees_source`
(`K = []`, `ret v`) is the headline tying the calculated machine to the kernel's
type-safety-verified `Source.eval`.

### `splitAt`/`dispatch` commutation (throws-only, D2)

A throws-abort resumes the OUTER continuation `Kₒ` and DISCARDS the inner prefix
`Kᵢ`; prepending a non-handler frame (`letF`/`appF`) only grows that discarded
`Kᵢ`, so the dispatch result is unchanged. Conditioned on `splitAt` finding a
`throws` handler (the only catching kind in D2). Facts about the imported
`Bang.splitAt`/`dispatch` (read-only); CANDIDATES TO PROMOTE to `Operational.lean`'s

/-! ### D3 store ↔ kernel-`EvalCtx` correspondence (state)

The kernel resumes state in its `EvalCtx`: a `handleF (state ℓ s)` frame stores `s`, and `dispatch`
threads it on `get`/`put` (KEEP `Kᵢ`, reinstall `handleF (state ℓ s')` — `Operational.lean`
`dispatchOn`). `evalD`'s store σ is the kernel side's `state` frames projected, exactly mirroring the
machine-side `Corr σ hs`/`hsStates`/`updateStates` triad but over `EvalCtx`. -/
