  Compat.lean — the Phase-B target list.
  `lr_fundamental` (Spec.lean) = induction over the typing derivation, one case
  per rule, each discharged by the matching lemma below. Proving all of these
  (in PROOF_ORDER) IS proving the fundamental theorem.

  STATUS (Phase A part 1, 2026-06-21):
    Stubbed — the previous content used Ctx/VTy/CTy as 0-arg types, but Phase A
    part 1 made them (Eff Mult)-parametrized. The compat lemmas need:
      (a) explicit Eff/Mult threading in every signature
      (b) the ADR-0019 two-context shape: GradeVec γ (Finsupp +/•) + TyCtx Γ
      (c) `U`, `F`, `ret`, etc. accessed as constructors (e.g. VTy.U, CTy.F, Comp.ret)
      (d) helpers like `var`, `unit`, `lamC`, `forceC`, `bindC`, `opC`, `handleC`,
          `HandlerRelated` to be either dropped (subsumed by Spec.lean's concrete
          Comp constructors) or restated as helpers atop the concrete syntax.
    Phase A part 2 will repopulate this file once Ctx arithmetic + the typing
    judgments are concrete in Spec.lean.

  Source map (preserved for the rewrite):
    - 10 standard CBPV lemmas: compat_var, compat_unit, compat_thunk,
      compat_force, compat_ret, compat_bind, compat_lam, compat_app
    - 3 effect lemmas (Biernacki Lemmas 5–7, with `lift`/ρ DROPPED for set-rows):
      compat_op, (NO compat_lift — deliberate), compat_handle [KEY]
    - 3 graded structural lemmas: compat_sub_eff, compat_weaken, compat_split

  Risk: all [STD]/recipe EXCEPT `compat_handle`, which is [KEY] — it is the heart
  of the effect side and where `Srel` (the 𝒮 half of `Krel`) is actually used.
  Prove `compat_handle` LAST per PROOF_ORDER.

/-! ## B.0 Convergence anti-reduction infrastructure (the workhorse)

The fundamental theorem proves `Crel n B e c c` — a computation relates to ITSELF, but observed
through `Krel`-RELATED (not equal) stacks `K₁,K₂`. So each compat lemma is a CONGRUENCE: relatedness
of stacks lifts through the same head former. The biorthogonal relations are phrased over
fuel-bounded convergence (`CoApprox`/`Converges`), so the workhorse is a CONFIG-LEVEL anti-reduction:

  shape: pitts-step-indexed-biorthogonality / benton-hur-icfp09 — head-expansion closure.

A *context-independent head step* `c ↦ c'` (one that fires `step (K, c) = some (K, c')` for EVERY
stack `K`, e.g. `force (vthunk M) ↦ M`, `case (inl v) … ↦ N₁[v]`) makes `(K, c)` and `(K, c')`
co-converge with a ±1 fuel offset. The PUSH steps (`letC`/`app`/`handle`) are the other shape: they
move a frame onto the stack (`step (K, letC M N) = (letF N :: K, M)`), so `(K, plug-form)` reduces to
the focused subterm under an extended stack — handled by `Stack.plug` unfolding directly. -/

/-- A returned config converges iff its tail does, after one bind step — but the universal workhorse
is: a config that takes a fixed first step `(K,c) ↦ cfg'` converges iff `cfg'` does. -/
theorem converges_cfg_step (cfg cfg' : Config)
    (hstep : Source.step cfg = some cfg')
    (hne : ∀ g v, cfg ≠ (g, [], Comp.ret v)) :
    (∃ n w, Config.run n cfg = Result.done w) ↔ (∃ n w, Config.run n cfg' = Result.done w) := by
  constructor
  · rintro ⟨n, w, hn⟩
    cases n with
    | zero => simp [Config.run] at hn
    | succ m =>

  · rintro ⟨n, w, hn⟩
    refine ⟨n + 1, w, ?_⟩
    rw [Config.run_step n cfg hne, hstep]
    exact hn

/-- A *context-independent head step*: `c ↦ c'` fires under EVERY stack, and `c` is never a bare
returned focus (`ret v` would be terminal, not a redex). The non-PUSH reductions
(`force (vthunk M) ↦ M`, the ADT eliminators) have this shape: they rewrite the focus in place
without consulting the stack. -/
def CIStep (c c' : Comp) : Prop :=
  (∀ (g : Nat) (K : Stack), Source.step (g, K, c) = some (g, K, c')) ∧ (∀ v, c ≠ Comp.ret v)

-- NOTE (inc-5): the `converges_plug_step`/`converges_letF_ret`/`converges_appF_lam`/
-- `converges_handleF_ret` frame-reduce bridges were DELETED. They bridged through the old
-- `converges_plug_iff` (RHS = the raw `(K, c)` config), which LR rekeyed to the machine-shaped
-- reshape config (`handlerCount K, canonStack K c, capSubstInto K c`, ADR-0054/0055); the bridges had
-- zero consumers (the fundamental theorem now goes through the machine-shaped `KrelS`, not these
-- convergence bridges). `converges_cfg_step` (the general config-level head-step anti-reduction) and
-- `CIStep` (the context-independent head-step predicate, used by `CrelK_head_step`) are retained.

/-! ## B.1 The environment relation `EnvRel` / closing substitutions

`EnvRel`, `closeC`, `closeV` are defined in `Bang/LR.lean` (§5.2b) — they are LR machinery the FROZEN
`lr_fundamental` statement (`Spec.lean`, ADR-0034 env-closed form) references, so they must live in a
module `Spec.lean` imports. The fundamental theorem closes an OPEN sub-term over a pair of
`Vrel`-RELATED substitution environments δ₁,δ₂ (Biernacki/Ahmed `G⟦Γ⟧`): the bare `c c` self-relation
is unprovable for open `c` (a `vvar i` is not `Vrel`-related to itself), so the induction invariant is
`EnvRel n Γ δ₁ δ₂ → Crel n B e (closeC δ₁ c) (closeC δ₂ c)`. -/

/-! ### B.1a `closeC`/`closeV` commutation (the substitution-descent lemmas)

`closeC` is a fold of single `Comp.subst`s (innermost binder first), so it commutes with every
NON-binding former structurally (each `Comp.subst` pushes through, and the fold follows). These are
proved by induction on the environment `δ`, threading the single-step commutation
(`Comp.subst v (ret w) = ret (Val.subst v w)`, definitional) through the fold.

The BINDING formers (`letC`/`lam`/`case`/`split`) push `closeC` UNDER a binder: `Comp.subst v` becomes
`Comp.substFrom (0+d) (shiftN d v)` for a sub-term under `d` fresh binders (`d=1` for letC/lam/case,
`d=2` for split). We name that binder-side fold `closeCUnderBinders d` and prove the distribution
lemmas STRUCTURALLY (no closedness needed — they merely re-associate the fold under the binder). The
closedness carrier enters only in `closeC_subst_comm` (below), where it collapses the `shiftN d` so the
bound value can be filled. -/

/-! ### B.1a″ Shift/subst commutation for a CLOSED filler

The standard de Bruijn shift-after-subst commutation, specialized to a CLOSED filler `u` (so the filler
needs no shifting): for `i ≤ k`,
  `shiftFrom k (substFrom i u t) = substFrom i u (shiftFrom (k+1) t)`.
This is what lets `closeV`/`closeC` over a closed length-`Γ` environment produce a CLOSED term (the
`ret`/`case`/`split`/`vthunk` closedness obligations of the fundamental theorem). Mutual structural
induction; `i ≤ k` so the binder cases step both cutoffs uniformly (`i+1 ≤ k+1`). -/
-- ADR-0054/0055 identity dispatch: caps don't shift on handle-crossing, so the `handle` arm recurses

/-! ### B.1b BINDING-former `closeC` distribution (`closeCUnderBinders`)

`closeC` pushes under a binder by re-indexing the environment: the sub-term under `d` fresh binders is
closed by `closeCUnderBinders d` (level-`d` subst with `shiftN d`-weakened fillers). These are STRUCTURAL
(induction on δ, the single `Comp.substFrom 0` step unfolds to the binding former's `substFrom` clause);
NO closedness is consumed — they just name the binder-side fold. `shiftN 1 v = Val.shift v` /
`shiftN 2 v = Val.shift (Val.shift v)` make the level-1/level-2 steps line up with the kernel's
`Comp.substFrom` clauses for `letC`/`lam`/`case` (d=1) and `split` (d=2) definitionally. -/

/-! ### B.1c The single-binder substitution-commutation core

`closeC_subst_comm` reduces (by induction on δ) to a single de Bruijn fact: filling a level-1 binder
with a CLOSED `v` then a level-0 binder with a CLOSED `w` is the same as filling level-0 with `w` then
level-0 with `v`. Both fillers must be closed: the second substitution traverses INTO the first's
filler, so each must be shift-invariant (closed) to survive the other's renumbering. This is faithful —
the values flowing through the CK machine's binders (a returned value, an env filler) are always closed
(ADR-0025/0030, the carrier now enforced in `Krel`/`Srel`/`EnvRel`).

  de Bruijn substitution lemma (Pierce TAPL §6.2 / autosubst `subst_comp`), specialized to two closed
  fillers so neither shift survives. Proved by mutual structural induction, cutoff `k` generalized. -/

-- For CLOSED `v,w`: `substFrom k w (substFrom (k+1) v M) = substFrom k v (substFrom k w M)`. The
-- cutoff `k` is generalized so the binder cases (which step to `k+1` with `shift v`/`shift w` = `v`/`w`)
-- reuse the IH at the SAME fillers. Mutual with the `Val`/`Handler` analogues.
-- ADR-0054: `handle` BINDS the capability at index 0, so the `handle` arm descends the body under one
-- binder (`k+1`) with the shifted fillers — but the fillers are CLOSED (`hv.shift`/`hw.shift`), so the IH
-- recurses at `v`/`w` unchanged, exactly like `lam`/`letC`. No cap-shift (that machinery is gone).

/-! ### B.1c′ NON-ADJACENT substitution-swap (for the d=2 `split` descent)

`closeC_subst2_comm` (the `split` case) fills two level-0 binders through `closeCUnderBinders 2`, which
after the first descent leaves the two substitutions at NON-adjacent levels (0 and `d+1`). The adjacent
swap above (`i, i+1`) doesn't reach it, so here is the general `i ≤ j` form, both fillers CLOSED:
  `substFrom i w (substFrom (j+1) u t) = substFrom j u (substFrom i w t)`.
The adjacent lemma is the `i = j` instance; this generalizes the cutoff gap. Mutual structural
induction; the binder cases step BOTH cutoffs (`i+1 ≤ j+1`). -/
-- ADR-0054: `handle` BINDS the cap at 0, so the `handle` arm descends both bodies to `i+1`/`j+1`; the

/-! ### B.1d The substitution-descent crux (`closeC_subst_comm`)

The lemma every BINDER case of `lr_fundamental` consumes: closing a body UNDER one binder and then
filling the binder with `w` equals substituting `w` first and then closing. For a CLOSED environment the
binder-side weakening `shiftN 1` vanishes (`shiftN_closed`), so `closeCUnderBinders 1 δ` substitutes the
SAME fillers as `closeC δ` but at level 1; the level-0 `Comp.subst w` then commutes past each via
`Comp.substFrom_swap_closed` (both fillers closed).

  shape: biernacki-popl18 §5.2 fundamental theorem — closing substitution `G⟦Γ⟧` commutes with the
         single binder-substitution introduced by `letC`/`lam`/`case`/`split` β-reduction. -/

/-! ### B.3′c ◊4.5b sub-block (f) — handler-frame `KrelS` intro + `compatK_handle*` cores

The answer-typed analogues of the old `krel_handleF*`/`compat_handle*`. The new `KrelS` has NO stuck-half
(`Srel` is gone — the op-stuck behaviour lives in `CrelK`'s biorthogonality, not the stack relation), so
the handler-frame intro is TRIVIAL: `krelS_handleF` says `KrelS …ε (handleF h::K) ↔ KrelS …ε K`, and the
ROW-DISCHARGE (body row `e` ⊋ discharged row `φ`) is `KrelS_eff_cast` (ε is inert in `KrelS`). This is the
SINGLE-ROW close of the original ◊4.5b wall — no two-row Biernacki `C⟦τ₁/ε₁{τ₂/ε₂⟧` needed (the row only
gated the dropped `Srel`). shape: biernacki-popl18 §5.4 set-row ρ-free collapse. -/

tail + the Kᵢ-threading RESUME CONJUNCT. The body row `e` is arbitrary w.r.t. `φ` (`KrelS_eff_cast`).
The conjunct (dispatched-config co-convergence at `m < n`, threading the captured continuation `Kᵢ~Kᵢ'`)
is SUPPLIED by the caller — throws via `crelK_ret` on the tail (zero-shot); state/txn via the resume
relation through `Kᵢ`. -/

The answer-typed migration of `vrel_fund`/`crel_fund`, wiring the `compatK_*` cores (sub-block c) over
`EnvRelK`. STATUS (ADR-0053, the LR 5→2): all non-handler cases AND the 3 handler cases CLOSED — the
absolute-cap representation dissolved the shift wall (`closeC_handle*` rewrite unshifted), so the arms
close on their `compatK_handle*` cores. The ONLY remaining `sorry`s are the 2 ADR-0043 descents in
`crelK_fund_up`: `hcatch` (cap-resolution at the producer-`up` edge) + the `:1801` cap>0 resume residual
— the deferred 5→0 set. The Kripke continuation indices use `∀ m < n` at the letC/case/split seams (the
`compatK_*` cores' ▷-guarded shape) and `∀ j ≤ n` would over-supply. -/

`crelK_fund`/`vrelK_fund` for the continuation/arg self-relation; the handler arms reuse the closed
