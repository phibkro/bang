  Compat.lean — the Phase-B target list.
  `lr_fundamental` (Spec.lean) = induction over the typing derivation, one case
  per rule, each discharged by the matching lemma below. Proving all of these
  (in PROOF_ORDER) IS proving the fundamental theorem.

  STATUS (Phase A part 1, 2026-06-21):
    Stubbed — the previous content used Ctx/VTy/CTy as 0-arg types, but Phase A
    part 1 made them (Eff Mult)-parametrized. The compat lemmas need:
      (a) explicit Eff/Mult threading in every signature
      (b) the ADR-0019 two-context shape: GradeVec γ (Finsupp +/•) + TyCtx Γ
      (c) `U`, `F`, `ret`, etc. accessed as constructors (e.g. VTy.U, CTy.F, Comp.ret)
      (d) helpers like `var`, `unit`, `lamC`, `forceC`, `bindC`, `opC`, `handleC`,
          `HandlerRelated` to be either dropped (subsumed by Spec.lean's concrete
          Comp constructors) or restated as helpers atop the concrete syntax.
    Phase A part 2 will repopulate this file once Ctx arithmetic + the typing
    judgments are concrete in Spec.lean.

  Source map (preserved for the rewrite):
    - 10 standard CBPV lemmas: compat_var, compat_unit, compat_thunk,
      compat_force, compat_ret, compat_bind, compat_lam, compat_app
    - 3 effect lemmas (Biernacki Lemmas 5–7, with `lift`/ρ DROPPED for set-rows):
      compat_op, (NO compat_lift — deliberate), compat_handle [KEY]
    - 3 graded structural lemmas: compat_sub_eff, compat_weaken, compat_split

  Risk: all [STD]/recipe EXCEPT `compat_handle`, which is [KEY] — it is the heart
  of the effect side and where `Srel` (the 𝒮 half of `Krel`) is actually used.
  Prove `compat_handle` LAST per PROOF_ORDER.

/-! ## B.0 Convergence anti-reduction infrastructure (the workhorse)

The fundamental theorem proves `Crel n B e c c` — a computation relates to ITSELF, but observed
through `Krel`-RELATED (not equal) stacks `K₁,K₂`. So each compat lemma is a CONGRUENCE: relatedness
of stacks lifts through the same head former. The biorthogonal relations are phrased over
fuel-bounded convergence (`CoApprox`/`Converges`), so the workhorse is a CONFIG-LEVEL anti-reduction:

  shape: pitts-step-indexed-biorthogonality / benton-hur-icfp09 — head-expansion closure.

A *context-independent head step* `c ↦ c'` (one that fires `step (K, c) = some (K, c')` for EVERY
stack `K`, e.g. `force (vthunk M) ↦ M`, `case (inl v) … ↦ N₁[v]`) makes `(K, c)` and `(K, c')`
co-converge with a ±1 fuel offset. The PUSH steps (`letC`/`app`/`handle`) are the other shape: they
move a frame onto the stack (`step (K, letC M N) = (letF N :: K, M)`), so `(K, plug-form)` reduces to
the focused subterm under an extended stack — handled by `Stack.plug` unfolding directly. -/

/-- A returned config converges iff its tail does, after one bind step — but the universal workhorse
is: a config that takes a fixed first step `(K,c) ↦ cfg'` converges iff `cfg'` does. -/

/-! ## B.1 The environment relation `EnvRel` (the open-term closure)

The fundamental theorem is `Crel n B e c c` — but the induction over `HasCTy` descends through
binders (`letC`/`lam`/`case`/`split`) into sub-derivations over a NON-empty `Γ`, where the
sub-computation is OPEN. The literal `c c` self-relation is then UNPROVABLE for the open sub-term: a
bare `vvar i` is not `Vrel`-related to itself (`Vrel n unit (vvar 0) (vvar 0)` demands
`vvar 0 = vunit`). So the faithful induction invariant closes the open term over a pair of
`Vrel`-RELATED substitution environments δ₁,δ₂ (Biernacki/Ahmed `G⟦Γ⟧`):

  shape: biernacki-popl18 §5.2 fundamental theorem (`G⟦Γ⟧η`); ahmed-esop06 closing substitution.

An environment is a `List Val` of CLOSED fillers (the CK focus is always closed). Applying it
(`closeC`) folds single `Comp.subst`s, innermost binder first. `EnvRel n Γ δ₁ δ₂` relates two
environments pointwise by `Vrel` at the corresponding `Γ` types.

STATUS: the frozen `lr_fundamental` (`Spec.lean`) is the `Γ = []` instance (empty environments,
`closeC [] c = c`). The `∀ Γ` form of the frozen statement is provable ONLY at `Γ = []` — surfaced to
the lead as a statement-shape concern (the open form needs the two-sided `c[δ₁] c[δ₂]` env-closed
conclusion, the ADR-0033-style tightening). -/

/-- Apply a closing environment δ to a computation: substitute index 0 with `δ[0]`, renumbering, then
recurse on the tail (each `Comp.subst` removes the nearest binder). `closeC [] c = c`. -/

  | [],      c => c
  | v :: δ,  c => closeC δ (Comp.subst v c)

/-! ## B.2 The return / value-injection compat core (`crel_ret`)

`Crel`-relatedness of `ret v₁` and `ret v₂` follows from `Vrel`-relatedness of `v₁,v₂`: a
`Krel`-related stack pair, by its RETURN half, co-converges when plugged with `Vrel`-related returns.
This is the biorthogonal "values inject into computations" closure (Biernacki Fig 7, the `F q A`
clause of `Krel`). It is the `compat_ret` core and the engine of every `▷`-free leaf. -/

theorem crel_ret {n : Nat} {q : Mult} {A : VTy Eff Mult} {e : Eff} {v₁ v₂ : Val}
    (hv : Vrel n A v₁ v₂) : Crel n (CTy.F q A) e (Comp.ret v₁) (Comp.ret v₂) := by
  unfold Crel
  intro K₁ K₂ hK
  unfold Krel at hK
  -- the RETURN half of Krel fires on `Vrel n A v₁ v₂` at the returner type `F q A`.
  exact hK.1 q A rfl v₁ v₂ hv


/-! ## B.3 Head-reduction compat cores (`force` / ADT eliminators)

Each of these formers takes a context-independent head step (the focus rewrites in place without
consulting the stack), so `Crel_head_step` reduces the goal to `Crel` on the reduct. The `Vrel`
hypothesis on the scrutinee value supplies the reduct's shape (a thunk for `force`, a tag for
`case`, a pair for `split`, a `fold` for `unfold`). -/

/-- `force` of `Vrel`-related thunks: `Vrel (U φ B)` unfolds to `Crel B φ` on the forced bodies, and
`force (vthunk c) ↦ c` is a CIStep. -/
theorem crel_force {n : Nat} {φ : Eff} {B : CTy Eff Mult} {w₁ w₂ : Val}
    (hv : Vrel n (VTy.U φ B) w₁ w₂) : Crel n B φ (Comp.force w₁) (Comp.force w₂) := by
  -- Vrel at U φ B: w₁ = vthunk c₁, w₂ = vthunk c₂, Crel n B φ c₁ c₂.
  rw [Vrel] at hv
  obtain ⟨c₁, c₂, rfl, rfl, hc⟩ := hv
  refine Crel_head_step (c₁' := c₁) (c₂' := c₂) ?_ ?_ hc
  · exact ⟨fun K => rfl, by intro v; simp⟩
  · exact ⟨fun K => rfl, by intro v; simp⟩

/-- `unfold` of `Vrel`-related folds: `unfold (fold w) ↦ ret w` is a CIStep, so the goal reduces to
`crel_ret` on the payloads. INDEX SUBTLETY (documented blocker): `Vrel (n+1) (mu A)` gives the
payloads related at the UNROLLED type but at index `n` (the `▷` guard, LR.lean §5.2), whereas
`Crel (n+1) (F 1 _) (ret u₁) (ret u₂)` consumes a `Krel (n+1)` whose return-half inspects
`Vrel (n+1)`. Bridging needs Vrel/Krel step-index MONOTONICITY (downward-closure): `Krel (n+1)`'s
return obligation, restricted to the reduct that only ever observes the value at index ≤ n, holds
from `Vrel n`. The monotonicity lemmas (`Vrel_mono`, `Krel_mono`, standard ahmed-esop06
downward-closure by induction on the lex measure) are the missing primitive — sequenced after the
clean cases. -/

    sorry


/-! ## B.4 `krel_refl` — the interface contract for `lr_sound` (the capstone)

The downstream `lr_sound` capstone (separate thread) closes as `lr_sound_closed ∘ krel_refl`: the
biorthogonal adequacy (LR.lean §5.3) instantiates `Crel`'s `∀ K₁ K₂, Krel … → CoApprox` at a
self-pair `(C, C)` known to be `Krel`-self-related, yielding the `⊑` clause for observation context
`C`. `krel_refl` is that "identity extension" (Biernacki/Pitts) — a well-typed stack is `Krel`-related
to ITSELF. It is the IDENTITY INSTANCE of `lr_fundamental` (the context's sub-computations
self-related, `c₁ = c₂`), so it falls out of the SAME induction; surfaced here as a NAMED lemma so the
capstone composes cleanly rather than re-extracting from `lr_fundamental`'s internals.

PREMISE: the stack is well-typed — `HasStack C e B eo Co` carries a focus of type `(e, B)` to the
whole-program type `(eo, Co)`. The typing is load-bearing in the STUCK half: a stack must eventually
handle-or-escape every operation it does not catch (the `Srel` clause's `splitAt = none` operations
tunnel out), which only a typed stack guarantees.

STATUS (gated on the two U6 blockers — see `crel_unfold` docstring + the lead handoff):
  - the OPEN/CLOSED statement-shape decision (the `letF N :: K` case substitutes `N[v]`, needing the
    `EnvRel`/`closeC` env-closure for the continuation's self-relation under its binder);
  - the μ/▷ index alignment (a `letF`-bound continuation returning at a μ-type hits the same
    off-by-one).
Both resolve `krel_refl` mechanically; the named contract is fixed NOW so the capstone thread can
reference it. -/
theorem krel_refl {n : Nat} {C : Stack} {e eo : Eff} {B Co : CTy Eff Mult}
    (_hC : HasStack C e B eo Co) : Krel n B e C C := by
  -- IDENTITY INSTANCE of the fundamental theorem: induct on `HasStack C …`, mirroring the
  -- `lr_fundamental` HasCTy induction (each frame's stored sub-computation related to itself via the
  -- matching compat core). The `nil` case is `krel_nil_succ` (LR.lean) at successor indices; the
  -- frame cases (`letF`/`appF`/`handleF`/`stateF`/`transactionF`) extend a `Krel`-related stack by
  -- one frame, using the sub-computation's self-relation. BLOCKED identically to `lr_fundamental`
  -- (statement-shape for the `letF` continuation's binder; μ/▷ for μ-typed returns). Contract fixed;
  -- body lands with the fundamental theorem.
  sorry
