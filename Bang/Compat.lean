  Compat.lean — the Phase-B target list.
  `lr_fundamental` (Spec.lean) = induction over the typing derivation, one case
  per rule, each discharged by the matching lemma below. Proving all of these
  (in PROOF_ORDER) IS proving the fundamental theorem.

  STATUS (Phase A part 1, 2026-06-21):
    Stubbed — the previous content used Ctx/VTy/CTy as 0-arg types, but Phase A
    part 1 made them (Eff Mult)-parametrized. The compat lemmas need:
      (a) explicit Eff/Mult threading in every signature
      (b) Ctx.scale / Ctx.add to be concrete (still opaque in Spec.lean)
      (c) `U`, `F`, `ret`, etc. accessed as constructors (e.g. VTy.U, CTy.F, Comp.ret)
      (d) helpers like `var`, `unit`, `lamC`, `forceC`, `bindC`, `opC`, `handleC`,
          `HandlerRelated` to be either dropped (subsumed by Spec.lean's concrete
          Comp constructors) or restated as helpers atop the concrete syntax.
    Phase A part 2 will repopulate this file once Ctx arithmetic + the typing
    judgments are concrete in Spec.lean.

  Source map (preserved for the rewrite):
    - 10 standard CBPV lemmas: compat_var, compat_unit, compat_thunk,
      compat_force, compat_ret, compat_bind, compat_lam, compat_app
    - 3 effect lemmas (Biernacki Lemmas 5–7, with `lift`/ρ DROPPED for set-rows):
      compat_op, (NO compat_lift — deliberate), compat_handle [KEY]
    - 3 graded structural lemmas: compat_sub_eff, compat_weaken, compat_split

  Risk: all [STD]/recipe EXCEPT `compat_handle`, which is [KEY] — it is the heart
  of the effect side and where `Srel` (the 𝒮 half of `Krel`) is actually used.
  Prove `compat_handle` LAST per PROOF_ORDER.
