  Distribution.lean — cashing the semilattice asset.
  NOT part of the verification spine (Spec.lean). This connects the effect
  algebra to the DISTRIBUTION axis of the Trinity. Two claims, clearly tiered:
    • `eff_join_semilattice` is PROVABLE from the semiring laws + idempotence.
    • `rowmonotone_coordination_free` is a CONJECTURE / research direction —
      stated to mark the asset, NOT to be proven as part of the spec.

  The unifying point: the SAME "algebraic structure determines mechanism"
  principle that drives recovery also drives distribution —
      semilattice (idempotent, monotone)  →  coordination-free   (CALM / CRDT)
      monoid      (sequencing, identity)   →  ordered, coordinated
      group       (invertible)             →  rollback / compensation (Frobenius)
  `group_recovers` (Spec §6) is the right end of this spectrum; coordination-
  freedom is the left end. Idempotence is what places bang-lang's `+` at the
  left.

  add_idem : ∀ e : Eff, e + e = e

/-- [STD / PROVABLE — UNVERIFIED] With idempotent `+`, `(Eff, +, 0)` is a bounded
    join-semilattice: join = `+`, bottom = `0`, order = the induced `≤`. This is
    the algebraic precondition for CALM/CRDT-style reasoning. Mechanical from the
    semiring laws + `add_idem`.

    ⚠ GATE: carries `sorry` — provable but NOT YET PROVEN, so NOT verified. This

-- A computation is ROW-MONOTONE when its effect grade only ever JOINS — it
-- never requires an additive inverse (never lives in the group fragment that
-- `group_recovers` targets). Monotone = "effects only accumulate".

/-- [CONJECTURE — NOT spec spine] CALM-style: a row-monotone computation is
    coordination-free. The distribution-axis analogue of the recovery story.
    Grounding: Hellerstein's CALM (monotone ⇒ coordination-free); Shapiro et al.
    CRDTs (state-based CRDTs ARE join-semilattices). A separate paper's result;
    stated here only to mark that the idempotence choice has already paid for
    the precondition (`eff_join_semilattice`).

    ⚠ GATE: CONJECTURE — carries `sorry`, NOT verified and not intended to be
    proven as part of the spec. This file is NOT imported by `Spec.lean` (the
    spine); do NOT import it into the spec path or its `sorryAx` leaks into the
